{"review": "<p class=\"partial_entry\">Attended a Tool concert here. If you wanna know if its worth it to come and attend a music concert at this venue, just one word of advice: Stay Away. The acoustics are terrible, if you are unfortunate enough to attend a rock concert here,...<span class=\"taLnk ulBlueLinks\" onclick=\"widgetEvCall('handlers.clickExpand',event,this);\">More</span></p>"},
{"review": "<p class=\"partial_entry\">First hockey game ever. It was a lot of fun. Bring ear protection if you are senstive to noise and make sure you eat prior to going. The food is silly expensive and the beer was $15!</p>"},
{"review": "<p class=\"partial_entry\">What a great venue! Security wasn't as brutal as I expected. The show wasn't sold out, but we weren't sure how bad it would be since we're visitors from Toronto and we are used to heavy security at events this big.\n\nSeating is comfortable and...<span class=\"taLnk ulBlueLinks\" onclick=\"widgetEvCall('handlers.clickExpand',event,this);\">More</span></p>"},

{"review": "<p class=\"partial_entry\">Great location with very good transport links. We have visited a few times now. Good food available. Watching a basketball game is always great fun with the family and adds a local experience to the vacation. Would definitely recommend</p>"},
{"review": "<p class=\"partial_entry\">Sec 211 Row 12 Seat 1. \nVery steep section so don\u2019t bring your Grandparents.  Way too steep of a section for them to climb.  If you got heart issues or out of shape, don\u2019t bother getting a seat in or around this section.

{"review": "<p class=\"partial_entry\">This review is about Barclays Center as a music concert venue, rather than as a sports venue - which is obviously what it was originally designed and built for.

{"review": "<p class=\"partial_entry\">Not sure why this gets such great reviews, it is a nice venue for concerts and games, and seats did seem close to the floor.
