rating,review
1,"Attended a Tool concert here. If you wanna know if its worth it to come and attend a music concert at this venue, just one word of advice: Stay Away. The acoustics are terrible, if you are unfortunate enough to attend a rock concert here, for sure the bass will be boomy, there is a lot of reverberations across the hall and even on the floor it will be quite impossible to make out the different instruments from the sonic muddle. Only MSG has some sort of good acoustics for a multi purpose arena in NYC. But Barclays is surely a waste of time, money and ears.Also food is pathetic, grimy and just so meh. Could never understand how a concert venue can serve worse food than an Airport."
2,"Sec 211 Row 12 Seat 1. Very steep section so don’t bring your Grandparents.  Way too steep of a section for them to climb.  If you got heart issues or out of shape, don’t bother getting a seat in or around this section.  Wish I would have paid an extra $50 for a better seat.   The monitors are madd small too."
2,"This review is about Barclays Center as a music concert venue, rather than as a sports venue - which is obviously what it was originally designed and built for. Although I have attended only one concert there (Oct. 2019), I am very unlikely to ever go there again for such an event. The problem: Horrible acoustics and audio production. Some fabulous performances were ruined by over-amplification to the point of obvious distortion, and by reverberation that is probably characteristic of the physical space. Expensive concert tickets (and they are expensive) will seem like a waste when you hear a favorite performer's music turned into a hash by the audio system and environment here."
5,Great location with very good transport links. We have visited a few times now. Good food available. Watching a basketball game is always great fun with the family and adds a local experience to the vacation. Would definitely recommend
4,Went to watch the opening match of the Netts v the timberwolves in the NBA and saw a great match and with no pillars don’t think there’s a bad seat but selling cans of beer at $15 each and footlong hotdogs at $11 you see what I mean. We got a cab from midtown manhatton and took nearly an hour due to heavy traffic even at six in the evening (driver says that’s normal). Coming back at around 1030 a little easierBE WARNED we had to check in our I pad as not allowed to take into match !!!?
5,"NYC Mamí has been hosted for a few events at the Barclay’s Center including a Nets Podcast and game, The Ringling Bros. Circus and a Harlem Globetrotters game.  They have so many shows for the whole family, concerts, and other events at this venue and it is pretty awesome.  It’s located right near the MTA train (many lines) and the LIRR."
2,"Not sure why this gets such great reviews, it is a nice venue for concerts and games, and seats did seem close to the floor.  But don't go out of your way to visit it unless you have a show or game to watch.  Not worth just a selfie outside."
4,"I very much like to have a great venue for any sport event. I am not a big fan to go there for a concert as I do not like the acoustic and sound there. But, the place is great, food is pricey but good variety, the transportation is very good!!"
4,"What a great venue! Security wasn't as brutal as I expected. The show wasn't sold out, but we weren't sure how bad it would be since we're visitors from Toronto and we are used to heavy security at events this big.Seating is comfortable and even from side-stage we had great sightlines.Pop holders at each seat. Ushers are polite and helpful.Water fountains and lots of snack and drink options.Should have more merch areas. I hate the big pileup at the front."
5,First hockey game ever. It was a lot of fun. Bring ear protection if you are senstive to noise and make sure you eat prior to going. The food is silly expensive and the beer was $15!
3,"I have been here about 5 times now for a show... Overall, the place is nice - very easy to get around and find your spots!The sound system really is not that good compared to other venues in NYC. Overall, it's an okay venue, but there are definitely better places to see a concert."
5,"Visited for the Iron Maiden gig in July. The venue is very easy to reach by subway- the exit from the subway brings you up right outside the main doors. Even as a visitor from the UK  The stewarding was helpful and polite, the seats comfortable with great views and most of all on  a very hot and humid evening there was adequate air conditioning!! Only problem was the cost of beer $15 for a can of Corona - outrageous! BTW the gig was great too!!"
4,"I've been here a few times now where I think it warrants a review.I've come for pro basketball, pro hockey, and a couple of concerts.  I will say that every event has been positive.  The arena is kept clean and feels like a first class operation.When I came here for a basketball game, I had something called LOGE seating, which I had never experienced before.  It's like something in between regular seats and a suite.  You essentially sit in a box area, with a counter, and by virtue of sitting there, you have access to a buffet and drinks.  That was pretty darn sweet.For hockey, I will say that it feels weird seeing hockey being played in this arena with the Islanders as the home team.  They definitely belong out on Long Island, and this is coming from a non-fan.  However, they do the best they can, although it definitely has that temporary feel.For concerts, I don't think I'm going out on a limb here saying that Barclay's was not built with great sonic abilities.  The sound, while not bad, is no where near as good as it is at MSG or some other arenas I've been too.  I'm not sure if it has to do with the design of the building, but while I enjoy coming to concerts here and the experience is generally fantastic, it certainly is not ""music"" to my ears the whole time.The staff is always friendly, security line is pretty fast, and the prices aren't the best, but you won't need to take out a loan to get a hot dog and a soda."
4,"Barclay's Center is a awesome venue for a Nets game, Islanders hockey team has played there as well, it's easy to get there as Atlantic ave has more trains stopping at this station than any other in NYC, the only problem with the Barclay's Center is the outside that rustic facade with a ""grass"" covered roof, idk who came up with that idea, but anyways the inside is plush comfortable and exciting for any event"
4,This time around we attended a Shawn Medes concert. We had floor seat and my daughter and her friend loved being so close to the stage.
5,"I took in WWE Raw and a Nets game within a couple of days of each other and its interesting to see the set up change so dramatically. Sadly the one thing that doesnt change is the price of food, but thats nothing new now is it! If you get a chance to glimpse the roof, its a garden!!! Cop that MSG!!!"
5,Awesome place for concerts ! Staff and security are very organized and kind. Stadium is clean and neat. Bathrooms are big and extremely clean. Highly recommend it!
5,I go here for Nets games and concerts.  It is clean and the staff is always friendly.  The food is improving but it all depends on what you like.  It is expensive but I guess that is how all arenas are.
5,"This is a very convenient location if you are traveling by LIRR, subway, or even car.  If you are driving, allow a little extra time because teh old streets get crowded during events.  There are many local restaurants and shops to visit before or after your visit.  Food is typically pricey during games and concerts, but not as outrageous as some other venues.  Very easy to move around, and easy access to doors."
5,We saw the Avett Brothers at Barclays on Saturday night. It is a good venue with plenty of bars and food options. We had good seats and enjoyed a great show. The staff was friendly and accommodating.m
4,"This was the second time I went to the Barclays Center to attend a concert. The lines were big outside but it was moving up fast. Didn’t have problems with the view from my seat, it was actually quite good having in mind that I was on the upper tier."
5,"Went for NYU Graduation. Nice stadium, many amenities, sound was excellent. In the heart of Brooklyn with easy access from several subway lines. Travel to the arena and parking can be a bear and costly too. Street parking available if you're patient and have the time. It was a long &amp; winding road and so nice to see my son get his Degree."
5,"I seen basketball games, hockey games and WWE events here. All of them great. Even always found street parking as well."
4,"Came here to watch the NYU graduation.  What a great venue: very clean environment, friendly staff, in a cute Brooklyn location.  Only issue was the graduation ran its full 3 hours so the concession stands ran out of food!"
1,"The arena is quite ok, however, the food prices are ridiculous. $16 for popcorn, $15 for a beer. Totally ruins the experience."
5,"We went a lot to watch BROOKLYN Nets basketball playing.The place is great,you get lots of food there,while watching the game. You have sport stores there."
4,Just another impromptu trip with my husband who loves basketball... From the outside you wouldn't know how nice the inside is. We had VIP access so the seats the lounge the pre-game good all very nice
5,"Brooklyn has done itself proud with the addition of this stadium; easy to reach, a delight to visit and among the most impressive and comfortable indoor stadiums."
5,Barclay Center hold many activities from sport to entertainment.Close to many restaurants and also source of transportation.City Subways and Long Island Railroad trains. Also land transporttion as in City Buses.Not sure how parking is available. All suggestions are to use public transportation.No need to go to Manhattan or NJ for Arena Entertainment.
5,"Love this stadium, entrances may be a bit confusing if its your first time. The American Express line was off to the side but very very convenient -got me in and directed me to the suites in no time. When I was trying to enter Barclays under GA was a MESS. Like any stadium expect over priced food. Live with it."
5,Saw raw at the Barclays center in April and it’s a beautiful arena and it’s great for concerts and events.
1,"I was so excited to see this show... Traveled from Long Island bumper to bumper traffic.When we get there, they were NOT letting anyone in until 630 ? Which is ridiculous!!!We wanted to sit down like adults and eat a nice meal in the revenue and have some drinks. And we’re told you can only get in if you are VIP or TSA  APPROVED ? Are you kidding me. WHERE DID IT SAY THAT ON THE TICKET. THINK ABOUT THE CROWED ? Cher is 73 years old . Don’t you think that the people coming to see her want to go inside and sit down, maybe walk around the Barclays center. WE WERE TREATED LIKE WE WERE A BUNCH OF TEENAGERS , WHAT DID YOU THINK WE WERE GONNA DO INSIDE THE STADIUM.. RIOT!! , this was the WORST PLACE TO SEE A SHOW.  WE ARE ADULTS THAT PAID MORE THEN $ 200.00 a ticket and you want to keep us standing outside . TERRIBLE  I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN"
3,This building is beautiful but not functional. The seats near the top are an accident waiting to happen. It is only a matter of time before someone falls and gets injured because the standing floor in the high seats is much too narrow.
4,"Sat in sec 219 decent view of the ice. Crowd  loud, but no comparison to Nassau Coliseum. Train ride here no problem left early. Stay away from sec 201 you can't see the goal"
1,"Last night (May 2, 2029) we went to the Cher “Farewell Tour” concert at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn NY. I would like to say I loved the show but unfortunately I can’t. Better to have listened to my CD collection. The Barclays Center is not a concert venue. The performance stage was set up at one end of the arena. Blocking our view were giant speakers and we saw very little of the stage effects. Barclays Center did have auxiliary viewing screens. However the viewing screens were of no help. They were positioned on the left and right sides of the stage facing out and were blocked by lighting equipment and seating. We purchased our tickets as soon as they were available. We did not buy the cheap seats. We were highly disappointed in attending this concert. With those giant speakers we should have had terrific sound. NO - the sound was absolutely terrible. It sounded like we were listening to the concert in a cave.  Cher was good not extraordinary. As you would expect the Bob Mackie costumes make Cher look fabulous (as Cher said she is 73 years young.) There was too many distractions - a 15  minute story about David Letterman, long sets of “filler” acts and acrobatics. Very disappointing we won’t be back."
5,If youre having a concert or any Major event its a good place because the subway station is right across and the facilities are in good condition so.. Have fun!
5,from down size neighborhood to architectural excellence this is  Barclays. in the  new revitalized place offering sport high night life and vibrant energy. 5 stars
5,I love going to Barclays Center for concerts and sporting events.  It is welcoming and so easy to get to.  Having a Shake Shack across the street also doesn't hurt.
4,We attended a concert.  Entry was smooth.  The visual appeal is compelling.  Lighting is great.  You feel like you are in a theater.  Audio is so-so.  Seat pitch is steep is certain areas making seating cramped.  Lots of lavs.  Maintenance of lavs is suspect. Conveniently located near subway stop; especially when you consider that parking is very limited.
1,We went to see the concert of H.E.R. and Erikah Badu as main act. Had tickets high up and the accoustic was terrible. We could not even understand what Erikah said and she is known for her interesting statements. There was another act before and between acts a D.J. who was not bad but we did come for the concert. The whole evening took 4 hours which is too long. On top of it we were so cold because the air condition was blowing a freezing cold breeze. A beer for USD 17: too expensive. What we enjoyed is watching the crowd which was really enthusiastic and great. But definitely not worth to buy a ticket for that. Public transportation accessability is great.
5,The venue is beautiful and the concert was on the money but the workers unorganized and the ushers just stand there and point fron a distance  to where you have to sit.otherthan that nice but I will not be back until they get organization with their staff.
3,"In the course of 6 nights I attended 4 events at Barclays Centre. The security guards were not very friendly but got everyone through very quickly. I was surprised when attending events involving sold out crowds how few vendors stayed open for the course of the night. During the Friday night NXT show, there were only two vendors open on the main floor. Now on a positive side the food I had was all very good and the prices were actually not above what I expected. Barclays Centre itself is a small enough arena where just about any seat you get is a good seat. The sound was also was very good. I’d attend future events at this arena."
3,"The arena is beautifully set up, great access to the subway and eateries. The venue is clean and well maintained but the price they charge for beverages is borderline criminal. Absolutely disgraceful. Didn't eat anything over the 4 nights I visited in a 5 day period so cannot comment on it although the pricing appeared more reasonable there.Obviously if you want to attend an event here you will just have to suck it up and pay $14+ for a beer."
5,"Great venue. No bad seats in the house. Great food. Since it’s opening, the events have improved. The only negative is the parking. Unless you want to either go nuts trying to find a place, or go broke trying to pay a parking lot, your best bet is public transportation. While there is a short walk to Juniors, for the best cheese cakes in the entire world. Worth the walk."
4,"Came here for Dwyane Wade's last game against the Nets. The sight lines were good, and getting in was a breeze. No bad seats, but I would sit in the lower bowl, fyi. Getting to your seats is easy, and they're comfortable. The audio was great,  and easy to hear. The food was good, but beer &amp; liquor prices outrageous, even compared to other NBA venues. Connected with Barclays Ctr. train station right outside the door, so use that to get there and to leave. Don't even think about driving here, because we didn't even see where the parking lots were."
3,"I was here for 4 events for Wrestlemania week. The arena itself is nice with good views from anywhere, as I sat in 4 different spots from 6th and 1st row upper bowl to floor seats. Beer prices were ridiculous in this place, $14-17 US, and the fact that they only do credit card at most vendors is bad for business as well."
4,Really nice venue - we were on Level 2 and could see action well. Really nice design. Only downside is drinks prices.
4,went to see my first hockey game there. it was such a great experience. although i don't know much about hockey it was quite an enjoyable game
3,"I went to a comedy show here on the night of April 12,2019.The show itself was great.The venue however could use some improvement,with consideration for the thousands of people who visit.The space between the seats is too narrow.Women's knees were actually an inch away from touching the back of the seat in front of them.The seats are also cheaply made,resembling more of a cloth covered folding chair.I had the misfortune of having a large bodied person seated on the left of me,whose meaty thigh spilled over onto the edge of my chair!I had to actually turn my body to the right to avoid his from smashing against mine.Hopefully the seating is better for different types of events.Otherwise,we will not attend anymore events at this venue."
4,"Visited here during a recent trip to New York for an event and is definitely the best arena I've visited. Massive ease getting to it with the subway right outside, really smooth getting in thanks to great stewarding. Easy to find seats which were comfy and had a drink holder for each seat and the whole arena inside and out is just stunning to look at."
3,"Went to see the Nets play the Toronto Raptor. It takes 2.5 hrs to play a 48 minute game.  Wow. Nice Centre, very clean and lots of staff. Food is ok ish although the price of the beer is out of this world and probably more than the Ritz Carlton. Really can’t understand that, bad one and then enjoyed water for the rest of the evening."
5,The Barclays center is a wonderful place. I am handicap and the staff went above and beyond to help.
3,"It's better than that rundown dump across the river and self proclaimed ""world's most famous arena"", but this could have been done so much better. The space has average acoustics for concerts and there are some seats with bad sight lines.However, if you have a good seat, the views are very good and the food choices aren't bad. A solid average rated arena"
4,"I was in Brooklyn for a college basketball tournament, so got to spend a few days in the area.  The arena itself is well designed, intimate, and very easy to maneuver around.  We walked in one day from Manhattan, over the Brooklyn Bridge.  3 mile walk from Wall Street and the weather was great, so the bridge walk is an adventure in itself and the walk delightful.Around the arena that are the usual options of sports themed places to get some basic food and pre or post game drinks.  McMahons, The Kings Beer Hall and Wolf and Deer are three options.The arena itself is simple in design.  There is a luggage storage room in the arena if you are traveling with your bags, and this became helpful for one of our group.  The Atlantic Terminal subway station is connected with the arena and we used it a couple of times to get in and out of Manhattan.  Very simple to use.Decent bars inside Barclay's, and sightlines were great in the arena.  Can't comment on food options.  Overall a good, modern and comfortable arena.  Staff were well trained and courteous.  We had a great time in Brooklyn!"
5,Great arena with good facilities and good.view.from all . A good experience overall. The food.was.ok.and the arena is well.linked with subway close
5,Our last visit here was for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Ceremony.  Its a great venue to see any show.  We are usually in a private box above the seats but there are so many large screens that where ever you sit you are fine!
4,"Saw the Rock and roll concert here and a few issues. First, access to watching performers enter was too guarded and you can’t watch the red carpet event from outside. The American Express vip entrance was moved without notice. The sound system was excellent but the ushers were talking to each other during the show."
2,"I'm giving this a two for the cheap seats.  I was sitting in section 222.  I'm barely 5'7'' and there is NO leg room.  The section is exceeding steep and if you need to leave your seat for any reason, it's very difficult to maneuver to the aisles.   You basically have to hold onto the people you are passing to avoid falling.Other than that, the concessions, while expensive, are tasty and there is wide selection, the bathrooms were very clean, the staff is helpful and friendly and it's very easy to access the arena via public transportation."
3,This is a new facility so my expectations were high.  We walked the entire concourse to look at all of the food options.  There were quite a few choices.  We opted for the burgers.  The food was mediocre at best and quite disappointing.  You expect higher prices in this type of venue but $7 for a 16oz bottle of water seemed just a little high.The seating was uncomfortable.  The seats were very narrow and there was no leg room.  We were in the middle of a very long row and every time someone tried to get in or out it was difficult for them to get by.The sight lines were good and numerous screens allowed you to see everything that was going on.  The ceremony was still great even though it was difficult to sit there for five hours without my legs getting cramped.
5,Getting in was easy and there were plenty of concession stands to handle the crowds.  Good variety of food and drink.  Comfortable seats and good veiwing.
5,We visited here for a Brooklyn Nets nba basketball game. Great atmosphere fantastic stadium full of typical razzamatazz.
5,"Came to see Elton John and used mass transportation, train to Penn Station, #2 Subway to Barclay Center.  It was perfect!  So happy with it all.  People were so nice and helpful.  Barclay is a beautiful venue and highly recommend it!"
4,"I had been to Barclays to see concerts before. The seats are spacious and the stadium is easy to get around in. This was my first time at a Nets Game. The energy was fantastic and the game was very exciting. The consetions were rediculously expensive. Credit is the only form of payment,  they didn’t accept cash. All in all we had a great time. I need to catch more games."
5,Great venue for Elton. Easy access in and out. Convenient area for dining and close enough to walk from our hotel.
4,We attended a Brooklyn Nets game here. Easy access from Manhattan via the subway and Atlantic Avenue. Large venue but higher level seating is challenging and a bit cramped. Still an enjoyable experience capped off with a Nets win.
5,"Saw the Nets play twice at the Barclay Centre on our trip to New York. Stadium is fantastic, great atmosphere and queues to get in were quick and efficient, so we weren't standing in the cold for too long! Will definitely return to watch the Nets the next time we are in Brooklyn!"
5,"We came here on the 6th March to watch the Brooklyn Nets- Cleveland Cavaliers game. The Barclays Center is easily accessed by the metro, and it is literally outside the station. The queue was long when we got there, but the wait to get inside wasn't too long. We had seats quite high up, but still had a good view. Drinks are very expensive, but we were expecting that so it wasn't an issue. I would definitely come back."
4,"My son and friends attended a hockey game at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, NY, and although the game was great, the venue was just “okay”. The location was convenient, just a few blocks from the railroad. The arena itself was nice, clean and well lit. Where the venue receives a lower score was the concession stands. After the second period, the stands ran out of food. Nathan’s had no more hot dogs, the pizza and sandwich stands closed down. ?? But there was plenty of beer for sale though! (liquid lunch) So if you attend an event at this location, make sure eat before you go or order your food early, or you may just go home hungry."
4,"We were recently in town for a basketball tournament at Barclays. The venue is easily accessible by public transportation.  Plenty of security around who were very helpful with directions. Getting an Uber to and from was simple even in congested traffic. The venue itself was very clean, lots of restrooms, very comfortable and roomy seats (didn’t feel squished in). The staff was very friendly. But the concessions were not good at all. While the food tasted ok the price points were outrageous leaving us to find somewhere else to eat before and after on our return visit. There are plenty of places to eat around the area and I think Barclays must lose a lot of customers as this seemed to be common complaint. Nice venue but not the best food and drinks."
3,defintely a cookie cutter arena.   nothing special compared to arena's around the country i have been to.   and please somebody explain the exterior to me.   this arena is fairly new yet the entire exterior is rust.   how is that attractive.now add to it the exorbinate pricing?   $16 for a soda?   $16 for popcorn?   real family oriented.   couldnt even find a water fountain to get a drink.
4,"Nice sports venue with reasonably comfortable seating in terms of legroom and good line of sight. Ushers are the most friendly I have experienced at a sports stadium or arena. Reasonably easy to get to by subway from NYC (the Q line goes directly there from Times Square or Herald Square). Food and drink prices are high, even by NYC standards. $7 for a bottle of water and $16 for an individual pizza or chicken tenders with fries! Getting gouged for food and drink takes away from the fun of the place."
5,Great venue! I haven't been to Madison Square Garden in ages. Best of entertainment visit this venue. Definitely take in a show here.
4,We wanted to experience either an American football or basketball game whilst in NYC.  There wasn’t a football game on during our stay and went to the Brooklyn Basketball.  The experience was great with all the razzmatazz you’d expect. The food /drinks inside were expensive but that’s the norm in these types of events/arenas wherever you go.  It was easy to find right next to a subway station and entry /exit were well organised. Subway back to Manhattan was busy and felt safe with the crowds even though it was quite late. Recommend it for the experience.
3,"I have been to all NHL arenas in the league and this one is the last on my tour.  Overall based on the in-seat experience and out-of-seat experience Barclays Center is solidly in the bottom 5. The exterior is visually interesting but in a way it has a slightly foreboding appearance with a very dark brown hull that presages the interior. Inside the entire arena is in black from top to bottom including the concourses and the seating. I mean it is 100% black which gave the entire experience a creepy dreary feel. The game I attended had a superhero theme and they had photo opps with costumed characters scattered around the lower concourse which was nice for kids. My seat was in the first row on the second level. All seats had cup holders attached to the back. The seat was pretty comfortable but the seats were quite close together, fairly typical of most of the other arenas. Since I was in the front row there was no seat in front of me but the seat pitch appeared to be pretty good in other rows. However the leg room was quite tight to the wall, making it awkward to stand to let other people step by. On the plus side the sight lines were good and the fidelity of the audio was excellent. I had a very disappointing “grilled” Italian chicken sandwich for $12, a big ripoff. The chicken breast had zero seasoning in it, literally it was a plain pale breast topped with a couple pieces of red pepper and onions with some pesto on a cold bun."
5,"While in New York we took in two hockey games, one at Barclays Centre and one at MSG. The tickets at Barclays were cheaper and much better value allowing us much closer to the action than at MSG. Personally we preferred the feel here, it didn't seem as commercial."
5,Great seating. Affordable for the show we saw. Lots of bar options. First I have seen in a concert facility. I liked it. Clean bathrooms for the most part. Lots of Taxis available to provide transportation. Great experience.
2,Well been there done that. Where was the atmosphere and show. The sound was low and it actually made me regret going there. Choose another stadium. I guess there is a reason for the higher status off Rangers
5,"Watched the Nets game on March 1st. It was an amazing experience, besides the $22 drinks and $15 boneless wings. Otherwise amazing."
2,"Went here to watch the Nets play. It was cold, and there was a line to get in from near the subway stop. Seemed to be moving quickly, but staff urged us to move to a side entrance instead. This was a shorter line but it took FOREVER to get in. Like seriously, all other stadiums I have gone to move faster. So I was quite cold and also mad cause I missed tip off.As for watching the game, sight lines are not as good as other arenas, like in Boston and Chicago. Seats are steeper walking up, but still, my view could be blocked by people in rows 2 or 3 or more in front of me. This doesn't happen to me in other arenas."
4,If you love sport like me then an NBA game is always a treat! Went to see the Brooklyn Nets v Washington Wizards! Got the subway No. 2 line from Manhattan to Atlantic Avenue/Barclays Center stop. It comes up right at the center which is very convenient. The center is great for a game although the beers were very expensive $15 for a can of beer plus a tip is expensive for a group. The sports shop there was very good so buy plenty of gear if you want to. Overall a very good night even though the Nets lost!
3,"Easily accessible. Quick entry and friendly staff. Decent beer selection, average prices for a sports venue in NY. Haven’t had a chance to try any food yet, we’ll save that for the next trip. Obviously not as grand as a place like MSG but it’s a fun little venue. Would love to see it really packed, probably has a totally different atmosphere."
5,"Great venue and view from all seats ,the game was exciting and very entertaining as it was our first game and  the atmosphere was loud and crazy .well worth going if your in New York .we got the subway there and back with no issues ."
5,"My kids played on the islanders ice as part of the Youth Hockey program. It was an amazing experience for all of us, I ended up as the score and clock keeper; sat at ice level in the booth :)We stayed to see the Islander beat Lightnings.Great place; very modern,  nice and clean. Easy to get to via public transportation; right across the Center are a few places to eat in the Mall, get there easier to avoid long lines."
3,Honestly I am not a big fan of its rustic look. It probably supposed to be like that but to me it just doesn’t look nice. Nevertheless the inside is quite nice. Arena is well lit and as always there are big screens so if you seat up high you would be able to see what’s going on on the stage from the screens.The food and drinks there are super expensive as in all places like that
5,"Brooklyn nets played the Lakers. It was the best night out I have had in ages -so much happening, what a spectacle. I have no interest in. Knowledge of basketball but that didn’t matter, it was a great show from 6.30 to 10.30. Don’t go hungry though, the food is horrendously expensive and pretty bad - $15 for a beer! Everything else - brilliant"
5,"Went to see Brooklyn v Pelicans and what an awesome basketball match it was, great arena and easy to get out of the stadium and home, that’s all you need really."
3,"What comes to mind when leaving Barclays Center after an NBA game is most of all their very dis-organized setup.Right from no information at the entrance to employees shouting information to each other, there is a feeling, that they seem unprofessional.The venue itself is good, and seats are good as well.I would go again though, as the quality of the game and presentation was cool."
5,"The arena was easy to get to and from, despite being close to full it wasn't too hard to move around or leave. The food was okay, but pricey, i think they could have had more variety. The seats were comfortable enough."
4,A great stadium with a subway directly outside.Food was plentiful and seats more spacious than Madison Square Garden.Great atmosphere.Word of warning they do not take cash!!! Make sure you have a card.
4,"Great to see hockey live. Expensive for drinks etc , Metro right outside , great experience . Would return"
5,"Saw the Islanders take on the Ottawa Senators. It was a real surprise, great atmosphere, great stadium, fabulously exciting game and a very nice little Italian across the road for dinner on the way out. On the down side, food and drink was very expensive, $45 for 2 beers and 2 hot small hot dogs!  Also took the subway on the way home to High St and then walked across the Brooklyn Bridge....magic"
5,We had tickets at the Barclays centre to watch the ice hockey great stadium absolutely massive with lots of food venders and bars to get drinks and snacks.Atmosphere was great
5,Visited the Barclays Center for the second time to watch an NBA game (Nets versus Jazz). Super convenient location just steps away from a subway stop and many eating/drinking establishments within easy walking distance. The arena is well designed with very comfortable seating and nice acoustics.
4,This arena is well laid out with great concessions including Starbucks drinks.  They have a bar that offers views into the arena.  Nice hotels within walking distance.
5,Went to see a basketball match here.  I’d never seen one and didn’t know much about the game.  We purchased online tickets only a few days before.  Our seats were quite high up but our view was great. Enjoyable game to watch and even as a newby to the sport I could follow what was going on.  Great for kids of all ages.  Food and drink is quite expensive inside the venue so eat before you go.
5,"Very easy to travel from the subway to the center its actually opposite. Arrive 30 mins early to avoid the long que.A fantastic atmosphere and very entertaining, much more than a basketball game. i would say the show including the game lasted around 2.5 hours. a great way to spend a Friday night. Food and drink is expensive but this is to be expected, anything like a football game here in the UK.i would recommend for the experience of a basketball game if your  staying in NYC"
4,"We visited the centre during our Christmas trip while staying in Manhattan.Getting the tube to the arena was easy from Manhattan, I can’t comment on other forms of transport.On arrival to the arena was approached by many people selling tickets on the street well above face value. One guy lead us to believe that the ticket window was sold out, reviewing the internet shortly before we knew this not to be true. One of the touts we noticed was showing other people screen shots of sold out ticket amounts to put pressure on people to part with their cash. It was still crazy busy outside the venue even though the game was starting. We queued up at the window and brought 3 tickets at face value we paid $37 per ticket to be at the front of the upper tier which was a few dollars more than being further back. The cheapest ticket I believe was about $34.The seats were great and at that price compared to what Maddison square gardens charge for the same sort of view which is probably an extra $80 on top per ticket. This is an excellent experience at a great family friendly price. Only grumble was there was only a few ticket windows open and the queue went right around the building to get in once you had your tickets.If I was to go again my top tip would be same seats and pay in advance to save time. We arrived in good time but it was pretty much the end of the first quarter when we got inside."
5,My husband and I went to see Phil Collins here in the fall.  We had seen him at the Wells Fargo Center in Philly and the concert was so great we got tickets for the show in NYC.  Our seats were excellent and were less expensive because they were on the side of the stage.  Which also allowed us to get up and dance.  We had excellent drinks made by a very nice bartender.  Can't wait until someone else we really like is playing there.
4,"I have had pretty good experiences at Barclays Center.Barclays is a decent size venue, so they typically host some big acts and a lot of moderately popular ones.  Most times we've attended shows there, security was pretty quick to get through.  If the entrance on Dean Street is open, use that because it's typically much quicker than the main entrance opposite the subway station. I don't consider the acoustics and sound quality of this venue to be quite as good as The Garden or Prudential Center, but we've had ok experiences.  We've seen everything from pop to orchestral music to alternative here, and I'd say the orchestral music sounded the best.  There are a lot of seat options with good views at Barclays.  We generally like front of section and/or aisle seats.  If you're in the 200 level side sections, avoid rows 5-12, especially on the aisle because your view is often blocked by people navigating around the stairwell.  We had tickets in Section 222, row 10, seats 25-26 (aisle toward stage) for Alt 92.3's Not So Silent Night Concert and were constantly having to look around people who were lingering on the stairs and taking forever to get to their seats.Price-wise, tickets at Barclays Center are usually cheaper than at Madison Square Garden.  We attended two dates of Ariana Grande's Honeymoon Tour and bought tickets for two dates of her Sweetener Tour; one for each at the Garden and one at Barclays.  Each time, the tickets for the show at Barclays Center were $50-80 less per ticket than at the Garden for comparable seats (200 level, front of section/aisles).  on average, we have paid $106 per ticket for shows we've seen at Barclays.  The cheapest was $75 per ticket for The Legend of Zelda Symphony of the Goddesses 2015 Tour.  The most expensive was $171 per ticket for Ariana Grande's Sweetener Tour in 2019.  If you can get presale tickets, do so.  Tickets at Barclays get picked up by scalpers pretty quickly and we've had slightly better luck during presales.Barclays Center is very convenient to travel to with a subway station directly in front of the venue and parking garages nearby.  Overall, though Brooklyn isn't the most convenient location for us to travel to from New Jersey, Barclays is a good option for concerts, especially when you can save a few bucks over other locations for shows playing elsewhere in the area."
4,"First time there, my bestie &amp; I went for a concert.  Very fun! But be careful, it's very steep.  At times while standing &amp; dancing, I thought I was going to fall over LOL"
5,"Great place to see Hockey and Basketball. Well organized and easy to find your way inside. Come early, lines can be long because of security checking."
4,We attended our first Nets game which was great fun as all basketball is in the USA. Easy to get in and to get tickets but as it is early in the season and Nets are kinda so so it was not surprising. Food is pretty good at Barclays as I have been once before to some fights but it is expensive. This is a great fun way to spend a. Hint with pals  your partner or a family but not a cheap option. Def go though!!
5,We attended a concert here recently and was not disappointed. The acoustics were good and venue spacious.  The only down side was that beer was rediculosly priced at 15 dollars for a can of lager so we only had the one!
4,We took a trip over from NYC to see the Islanders play and got super cheap tickets but were super surprised at the price of beer.  It cost us $29 USD for a bud light and angry orchard.  We paid $30 USD for our two tickets.  We were also surprised that the vendors were mostly closed and really wondered why one whole section was empty.  We wandered over and realized why!  You can't see the net!  Clearly not meant for hockey!  Over all a good experience but pretty pricey drinks!  A bucket of popcorn was $15.  It was refillable but still how much can one eat?  A bit much for my taste!
5,"We where staying in Brooklyn so decided before we left the UK to take in a game. It was the day after Thanksgiving and mega busy,This place is massive but well signed and the staff where really helpful. A bit pricey to say the least..$13 for one can of beer but never mind as it was a one off thing.... We watched the Brooklyn Nets....they lost!"
4,"Sports is not really my thing. We came to see the Brooklyn Nets as a compromise for going to a Broadway show. It blew my mind. As always American production blows everything else out of the water. Basketball is a great, fast moving game but my favourite thing was the cheerleaders with attitude. Drinks were slightly pricey and the queue to get in was really long, but half the price of the Mets!"
5,"I had looked at MSG but the prices were too steep, the Barclay center is more reasonable and easy to get to being directly opposite a subway exit. The view was good, the event was extremely well put together. Like all sports events you need the home team to do well to help the atmosphere, unfortunately not in this case but still enjoyable for the neutral.There are plenty of food and drink options along with merchandising round the concourse. The center is also extremely clean."
4,Having been to hockey at MSG the night before (Canucks were in town playing back to backs) I can safely say Barclays Centre is definitely the better venue. Anyone in the arena was a fan whereas at MSG it was mainly corporate freebies and curious tourists. This is a modern new arena with solid game presentation and good public transport links. Drinks are expensive but so is every arena and it was only $1 more than MSG and T-Mobile (in Vegas)Blah blah blah sight-lines. Islanders fans love to complain about how some seats have poor sight lines for hockey (which they do) but just avoid them. It’s nothing worse than being in the gods at MSG and having to watch the game on a screen on the back of the Chase Bridge which hangs so low it hides the scoreboard. At least Barclays Centre is a more reasonable price for ‘bad’ seats
5,The Barclays Center hosted the nets vs 76ers game which was an experience of a lifetime. Get a good center seat and you won’t regret it
5,Excellent night with 8 bands in a total of 5 hours. Well organized with little drag between sets. Venue is clean with many options for food and drinks.
3,Attended a Brooklyn Nets game here. Easily accessible by train. Staff were friendly and helpful. Clean facility. Downside is the price of food and merchandise on site. Very expensive.
4,"It was my first time to be at this venue for a concert. I had bought a cheap ticket, and my seat was on at the very end. It was ok but I found the sound a little problematic. I recommend no to be that far to enjoy a better event. As for parking, on Saturday night I was able to find a free spot on the street  blocks away."
4,"We have been to Barclays multiple times for concerts and children shows.  The security process isn't bad, I always bring a small bag for my phone, money, and keys.  There are metal detectors and bag check so bringing less is the best idea.  We get in quickly and the arena isn't huge where there would be a lot of walking to get to your seats.  I will say parking is hard to come by as there isn't a designated parking lot.  But mass transportation  is available for the area.  The alcoholic drinks were made well each time we have attended shows so I don't have any complaints."
3,"The center inside was nice and you felt cozier than MSG, but the roads around could not handle the traffic,  We saw Phil Collins here and enjoyed the venue with 2 exceptions- 1 they stopped all food and drink 1 hour after a concert BEGAN -  policy. Phil was slated for 8 although he didn't come out till 8:30 which meant there was a 1/2 hour window you could get anything to eat or drink. My husband drove in and was very stressed from the ride (accident on GWB). He was frustrated to find upon needing a 2nd beer, that all food service was stopped, How bizarre and how much money did they lose? We were so hungry and thirsty after that we had t stop at a restaurant. 2 - less important for most- the family bathrooms during concerts are locked because people were smoking in there.  Seemed like they had a lot of people stationed to help but did not give them the proper tools or access."
4,The arena is so easy to get to - get out of the subway and you practically walk into it. There are the usual security checks when you go in but we expected that. Once inside the staff are friendly and helpful and the facilities are excellent. The seats inside the actual arena are extremely comfortable which is a big deal when you’re sitting for a couple of hours. It’s perhaps a little cramped but not so bad that it stopped our enjoyment. I’d definitely recommend this place if there’s something going on that you want to see.
4,"We were there to watch a hockey game, and is nothing less than impressed, ""The States"" will just make things bigger and better.We were there just after Veterans Day, beautiful to see how to honor those who have fought."
5,I’m actually sat here now waiting for the gig to start and have to say I’m extremely impressed by this huge venue. On arrival the staff were second to none. From security to ushers and beyond. We had a small issue. I have a broken knee and couldn’t get my leg behind the seat in front. We were directed to customer care and thanks to Isaiah we were relocated without any issue. Fantastic service.
5,"We saw the Keith Urban concert and the venue is just great. Perfect view from most seats, very good food stands and easy access to restroom. The sound was great too."
2,"Imported beer $17.00, domestic $16.00. Soda $7.00. Fries $8.00 Water $7.00..Water...Hamburger $12.00  2 Hotdog deal $15.00..Concessions fail the public at these prices.  Beautiful facility with great staff, great views, booming sound system. Plenty of Mass transit. It's the food Morris, the food."
5,"My 1st time early this month. I've been to quite a few arenas, stadiums, etc, and Barclays is BY FAR the cleanest I've ever been to. I really enjoyed it there, I wish it was closer to my home, I'd go more often! The employees were SURPRISINGLY extra friendly and helpful. Typical expensive prices on the food and drinks but there is a great variety of different foods. Great place and basketball games are super fun!"
4,"We recently saw Gorillaz perform here and found the arena to be a very good venue. It was easy to navigate inside and there appeared to be a good selection of food available. Bathrooms were plentiful as well. We attend several concerts per year in many different venues and found this to be among the best. Acoustics are very good! Seats are roomy enough for the average sized person. Two things kept me from giving this property five stars. First, food and drinks are very expensive. $14.50 for a beer is pretty steep anywhere. Secondly, there was much confusion from everyone we spoke with on where the proper entrance was located. It would be a simple matter to print on the tickets or post signage around the outside. However, don't let this stop you. I recommend this arena to anyone."
4,We attended a Kpop concert.  The seats were a little far away than I would have preferred but they were still good and we could see the whole stage.  If I went to a concert again I would definitely buy seats closer to the stage
3,"The Big 3 Basketball game was entertaining within an arena with strong security. After 7 p.m.   free parking is available within the vicinity. Regarding the dining experience, we searched for premium dining. Yet, only fast food was available. Caution: there are no returns if you step out of Barclays."
4,"Arrived on holiday and this is our first event and buzzing for Drake.  Been to the Barclay Centre once before to see Coldplay.Initial thoughts when arrived was a it chaotic, no one directing you to right queue and risk you are wasting time standing in wrong queue, confusing and not easy.Travel light as bags are checked upon entry.Drinks extortionate at $13 a beer, for it to be handed in a can but hey what do you do.Inside we were up in the gods, not by choice, just a late decision to try and get some tickets.Very steep, if stairs or heights are not for you then not a good choice.  We were up as high as you can go and a headache fetching drinks and toilet trips however we were lucky enough to be on the end of a row.  Lots of fellow concert goers needed a little support when squeezing past as so little room and daunted by the big drop down.What I love about the venue is the can see wherever you are, 360 degree view.Seats comfortable enough. Toilets clean and tissue throughout.Venue holds about 16k people.Venue WiFi and cell coverage almost non existent.Had a great time, Aubrey is amazing and what a great show!! Great first night of holiday.Visited 01/09/18 YB NYC Drake Barclay Centre."
4,Took my grandsons to see the circus never been before a great experience was had by me and my grandsons would like to go again unfortunately  the circus is done
5,My husband and I want to see the Garcia fight. It was very easy to take a lyft there and walk a few steps to the entrance. Our seats were in row 106 and we can see perfectly
5,"I've been to Barclay's twice for a concert. Once I sat all the high up, and once I sat all the way by the stage. Both times I had an enjoyable time. I couldn't see the best from on top but I had a good enough view."
1,"Went here for the WWE raw taping. We enjoyed the show but the prices this venue charges for food and drinks are straightforward insane.8 dollara for a hotdog, 14 dollars for a non refill soda, 11 dollars for some Mac n Cheese. Ridiculous!!"
5,We were there for the first time for the 10/05/18 Bruno Mars concert. Easy to find. Very well organized crowd flow and friendly staff.
4,"I have been to a number of events at the Barclay Center since it opened. The seating is a little off. If you are in the lower sections it is fine, but if you end up in the upper tier it is very steep. They have a number of food vendors and a good variety. It is conveniently located to all subways, as well as the Long Island rail Road. (Just likes MSG, you walk upstairs from the trains-Atlantic Ave. Terminal-and the venue is right there). There are also a number of very good restaurants within walking distance. If you’re looking for street parking you need to get there early. They are expanding on the parking lots, but for now, I try to avoid the ones that are closest, as it is as it takes a while to get out."
5,What a great venue for boxing not massive so you can actually see the fight really good seats all the way around. Good hot dogs too
4,"Wow!  Barclay's Center is a beautiful place!  We were impressed with the how clean it was, the comfortable seats, and the friendly and helpful staff... everyone from the security to the ushers to the food and drink servers were great at their jobs.  We loved getting off the Subway and riding up the escalator to see Barclay's come into view.  My only complaint was $7 for a bottle of water is robbery!  One of my biggest pet peeves in the tourism industry is when places jack up the prices for tourists and you have no choice but to pay them because no outside food or drink is allowed in the building.  While we didn't eat anything (we made sure to eat at reasonably priced places prior to the shows) there was a good variety of food to choose from and it did look like it was good quality."
4,"Contrary to what Long Islanders would tell you, it was great watching the New York Islanders play at Barclays Arena. The view from my seat was fantastic, as I made sure in advance that it was unobstructed. The food options were incredible, and the arena is spacious and clean. Overall, we had a very good time."
5,"Very nice venue, next to a metro station, excellent quality in the seats, nice screens, everything was excelent !Fantastic watching a NBA game ( Brooklyn Nets vs Chicago Bulls)."
4,Took my husband to see his favorite performer Shania Twain at the Barclay center. Concert was great and the staff at the Barclay were very nice and helpful.
5,"We really enjoyed our conference here. It's a beautiful venue, very clean and the Suites were very comfortable!"
5,"We visited the Barclays Center 3 times while we were in New York. We watched an ice hockey game &amp; 2 basketball games. The atmosphere in the venue was amazing. The seating is realky good and well layed out. I'm quite short but even if someone sat front of me I could still see fairly well. We pre-booked our tickets via stub hub, ticketmaster &amp; viagogo. Some of the eventually mobile entry tickets others you need to have the tickets printed off - check before you arrive as we saw people being turned away. Food &amp; drink was quite expensive but we only bought enough to share between us. On one of the events we were given a free t-shirt each as part of the Brooklyn Nets fan promotion.The events are amazing to watch and it felt more like a show as there were intervals, cheerleaders &amp; entertainment throughout. A basketball game lasted closer to 3 hours. Definitely go and see an event here."
4,Was at the Barclay center for Justin Timberlake concert. Had a great time.  Would have given it the full amount of stars if I didn't have to go to another level to get drinks.
3,"Super steep stairs and as expensive, not the best place to enjoy a concert as you can hardly move in your tiny seats and forget about standing up, you may roll down the precipice lol They do have a bar and some concession stands..."
4,"Visited the barclays centre 4 nights in a row for the wwe shows including summerslam. The place is great, comfy seats.  The only complaint is the price of food and drinks. $7 for a bottle of water $13 for coke. WTF."
2,"Joel Osteen and his family was everything I expected them to be and much more.  I absolutely plan on seeing him again - but NOT at the Barclay's Center!First - Parking.  OMG horrible.  Big venue, no parking.  HUH?  We found a place and for NY it wasn't too badly priced.  It was however a couple blocks away.  Second - Because of the horrendous traffic making a 1.5 hour commute nearly 3 hours long we were unable to grab a bite to eat before the show so we settled on popcorn, one hot dog and two sparkling ice drinks... $32!!!  I know I know these placed are crazy expensive but $7 for a $1 sparkling ice drink?  And I gotta hunt for parking... come on.Third - ladies room - not good at all Barclays!!  I hope I don't need an antibiotic from the drama.I'm a Jersey girl - not a NY fan at all but I go when I have to.  But the only way I would go back to Barclay's is if Jesus himself was there."
3,"We went to see Sam Smith in concert and had complimentary tickets from a radio station.  We were seated very HIGH up and it was difficult for me to sit in these seats.  They are steeply pitched.  I was glad when people filled in around us.  The sound system was horrible and the vibration from the drums reverberated through our bodies.  When Sam spoke, sometimes we could not undertstand what he was saying.  On the plus side this is a VERY ACCESSIBLE concert venue from Grand Central Station.  Take Subway 4 and you will arrive right in front of venue.  Staff are all very helpful and very friendly.  Very professional staff.  The venue is bright and very clean.  So are bathrooms.  Would go there again if I knew acoustics would be much better."
2,"OMG, could not understand anything the singer was even saying when the music wasn’t playing! Shame on you Barclay’s Center. Extend the sound system or I’m never coming back and recommending all my friends to stay well away too. Shame shame shame!"
5,I have been there for concerts with my family and with my friends. Always a good time. Wonderful atmosphere and filled with positive vibes.  Love it.
1,"Trust me on this one, the acoustics are horrible. The neighborhood is great for shopping and food. But, if you choose to see a concert, go to Madison Square Garden"
3,"Went to a basketball game and sat in the LAST seats in the venue- at the very top of the Barclays Center  but we could still see the game, without having to look at the big screen. The only downfall are the steps being VERY steep. The escalator only goes so far and you have to walk up a lot of steep steps to get the the ""cheap"" seats."
5,"Finally made a trip here and we loved it. There does not seem to be a bad seat in the house. The sound system is great, so is the staff. Good food choices for an arena as well. Easy to get to from Manhattan."
3,"Joel Osteen is great motivating religious leader I went to see him in my old neighborhood in Brooklyn where I spent 22 years of my life. Pastor Osteen was preaching at the Barclay Center, a nice venue but parking at the Barclay is terrible. I was a season ticket holder when the Nets played in New Jersey where parking at the Meadowlands has just steps from the arena. In Brooklyn parking your car is difficult and expensive. I purchased an online parking pass but the facility I was sent to would not accept it, they wanted cash. How can they build a beautiful arena and not provide parking?"
5,This arena is located in a genuine spot and has transit connection right outside the arena. The game experience is very fun and keeps the crowd in the experience. You will have fun and enjoy your time in Brooklyn!
5,"Friday 7/13/2018 my husband and I saw Joel Osteen at the Night of Hope. The show was amazing. Our seats were great, first row closest to the floor. The arena was packed but the big screens made it easy to see for the people who were in the higher rows. The lines flowed smoothly through security even though there were so many people. It was very well organized and controlled. I have been to a few events here and each time I have had great times. Looking forward to another show whenever I have a opportunity."
5,"Easy to get, really nice place for concerts. I ‚ve been there for a Depeche Mode concert. Next to the subway, easy access, clean stadium, nice seats. It was a fantastic night."
4,$20 for a gin &amp; tonic and $7 for water WHAT A SHAME they came to rip off BKLYN.NOT COOL. Otherwise the space is great.
5,I visited this place on many visits with my grown-up children and they were always entertaining. My kids loved the visits and always gave thumbs up every time.
5,I only went to the gift shop but it was just as fun. They have very unique pieces from the NETS and great souvenirs. The staff were friendly and helpful.
5,Went there with the wife for my birthday and had a wonderful time. It was my first salsa concert got to see my neighbor and his wife there also.
5,"I came here for Soulfrito, a Latin music Festival. I liked the set up of the stadium! The prices for drinks are very pricey, beautiful area and stadium."
3,Gone to three concerts here. It does not matter how good your seats are or near the stage I could not hear the singers
2,"Seen Depeche Mode play here last week.Must be one of the most expensive places on earth to buy food and drink ???Doesn't the stadium make enough profit out of ticket sales ? so they gouge customers.Sure it's your choice to buy food and drink at the stadium but this is way to excessive. People should refuse to buy at the stadium until they get the message, it's not OK to charge people $7.00 for 10 cents worth the soda ! and $9.00 for a 6 inch hot dog."
3,The Barclays Center is great for sporting events and concerts but a bit on the scary side when in the seats.  Very short steps very high angle.
3,"I attended my nephew’s graduation ceremony there and we were seated in the balcony where the seats are steeply pitched. We were afraid to stand up to cheer the graduates for fear of toppling over the rails. It was very Very unnerving. If I was to attend a concert or game there, I would go for the floor seats."
4,"My husband and I visited my daughter during a trip to NYC. She showed us around Williamsburg, a very young and lively neighborhood in Brooklyn. We stopped for drinks and something to eat at Barclays as there was a band playing jazz. We very much enjoyed the drinks, the food and the atmosphere in this place. Would highly recommend."
3,"The arena is not very big but it is beautiful, the pitch is well looked after, sitting is comfortable, access to public transport is easily available, plenty parking areas around the stadium."
4,"Barclays center in Brooklyn is a great venue to watch a game. It's very convenient to go to because its easily accessible to public transportation. Train station im front,  uber always around the area."
5,"We watched one NBA(basketball) game- Brooklyn Nets vs Detroit Pistons; and one NHL (Hockey) game- NY Islanders vs Philadelphia Flyers, in our last visit to New York. Barclay Center is a very good alternative to Madison Square Gardens if you don't want a hole in your pockets afterwards. The total price for a family of 4 was USD 110 with very good seats specially in the hockey (quite high up but right in the middle of the longside). The ""Q"" subway  brought us  right infront of the entrance to the arena. Entrance and security was fast but detailed, and very profesionally handled. If you want fast entrance , do not bring any bags. Otherwise you queue in a different line having bag search. The establishment is very modern, escalators well situated, and lots of eating places around , both inside the arena and outside. If you come earllier, you can visit/shop in the galleria beside, to while away the time. The games were very exciting and no time to get bored during breaks as you are offered a lot of various entertainment like cheering perfomances,fans/audience participations, videos, free T-shirt throws, etc. We had two great sports experiences."
5,"Fantastic arena, our seats had a great view of Jay-z on stage, modern, well built and smack bang next to the subway for east access to and from the arena."
3,First time at Barclays and I would say average at best. First I would say the ticket process confused me. I wanted and would of been willing to get better seats but was not allowed to on line. Then while at game all those seats were empty. Getting into building was easy and well done. People still complain about being searched need to get over it. Lots of the food and beverage places were closed but the ones open were expensive for what they offer and we got some small things and decided to wait until after the game to get food. I would do the same if we go again. The “candy” store is a joke $25 for a lollipop. Ice cream person was so rude and prices were worse there then anywhere else. No thank you and left. The game was good so that helped but will not hurry back as many other places to see events.
5,I went here 3 nights in a row to watch WWE events and thought it was kind of the perfect arena. Whoever designed it has done a great job
4,"My dates are off but I've seen some of my favorites at The Barclays StadiumIt is convenient to get to, with all of NYC trains close...you can dine before the show and hangout after the show. The area is perfect for a good time. Seating can be tricky and scary!!Do not sit in those upper upper seats.#Beyonce #BrunoMars #CharlieWilson #Fantasia"
1,"My experience was downright despicable.  What kind of security does the Barclay's have? Not a good one, there is no reason why you have to wait out in the rain to gain access into the arena.  They do not stack up to MSG, RadioCity, Beacon, or any of the other venues when it is time to gain access into the arena.  Most of all I'm upset since I missed two acts of the concert which I paid good money for.  Not a happy camper nor will I be going back there!  Ruined my Mother's Day evening out.  I will not recommend for a nice evening out.  Please find a better way for patrons to attend an event without feeling like you will be trampled."
5,"I cannot say enough good things about this place. My crew and I went to the Barclays twice this past August, both for WWE shows, and had the time of our lives. The first event -- a Meet and Greet with WWE Superstars -- was well-run and handled in an orderly fashion. We had a brief phone conversation with Annie, one of the Event Managers, a few days before and she assured us photo ops would be handled professionally... and she did not lie. It was awesome. The second WWE event we attended there, which took place the day after the Meet and Greet, was another fun, organized affair. We got our money's worth and more and I cannot thank the Barclays Center and its friendly staff more for it!"
3,"I've been to a few UFC events around the USA and the Barclays Center is a really great place to watch the fights, It's not a big venue so even if you end up buying cheap seats you getting a great view ( Pro tip - If you are going to a UFC event don't bother with floor or low tier seats as they cost a fortune and they have the worst views )The only negative was the price of drinks, and yes I expect to pay more when at an arena but $18.50 or £13 is ridiculous and to make it worse it was served out of a warm can and poured into a cheap plastic cup. Apart from that this is a really good place to go and see an event, just get ready to put on your best poker face when the barman hands you the bill."
4,"If you're a tourist in NYC and you want to watch a ball game, going to watch the Brooklyn Nets is a great alternative to watching the New York Nicks play basketball. The Nicks charge $180+ a ticket, whereas we paid $36 each for the Brooklyn Nets (and they weren't the cheapest tickets). Sure, we were up high but we could still see a lot and the atmosphere was great - shame the home team lost :-(The food at the venue was tasty and not too pricey, but the drinks were ridiculously expensive - shame really"
4,"The Barclays Center has all of the amenities to make attending an event a good time.The concourse is wide and easy to navigate.  There are many options for food and drinks, including a candy store with many options.There are a good amount of entrances to the venue so waits are not long to get in.I have been to many hockey games here and a concert.  The concert setup was fine.The drawback is that they did not design the building for hockey and many seats are not good.  This was a mistake in design and they are not willing to make the changes required.I am sure that it is good for basketball, but I have not been there for that."
3,The place is easy to get to with plenty of parking options and of course the subway.  There is plenty to do in the area and it is clean and safe.  The seating is not at all designed for NHL games which is why we were there.  The upper deck seats are very high and make watching the games difficult but the lower level seats were fine.  I don't know how long the Islanders plan on staying here but the seating will need to change as in several sections you are angled away from the action.  The concourses are big and offer a very good variety of food and drink options.
5,"The crowd, the experience, the surprise's the big event and paperview of the summer!  Loved it took alot of photos"
4,"We got tickets for the Brooklyn Nets vs Dertoit Pistons for $25 each, a great price for NBA tickets. The arena itself was great, easy to reach by subway and no hassle getting through security etc. Our seats were great with a great view of the court.The food stalls were another story, we ordered a beer, a coke and 2 hot dogs and it cost $49! We have been to NBA games in LA, Orlando and Toronto and have never seen prices like this for food and drink. At a Toronto Raptors game a week earlier, the same order cost me CA$28 and this had free refills on the coke. I can't understand how they can get away with charging these prices. But this was the only negative on our visit, everything else was great."
5,"I was visiting Manhattan on a businesstrip and interested in attending ahockey game, 3 April versus the Flyers.I did not think I could attend because of difficulty getting there.However, the trip was easy - subway #N downtown to Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn.You then walk 5 minutes to the B Center.To return, the subway stop is directly in front of the Center.I also have heard that for hockey the B Center is terrible because of obstructed views. I sat in an obstructed view section and I could see everything minus other seat sections.  The seat was excellent.Thus if visiting Downtown NY do not cut off events at the Barclays Center because you believe getting to Brooklyn will be too tough as via subway line #N access is easy and quickTo pay for the subway you can purchase a round trip ticket for approximately $5 and $3 for seniorsIn fact the only time I might not go is when Conor MacGregor is at the Center.Also of note getting to Yankee Stadium is easy via line #D"
5,what a wonderful venue-------easy access by public transport or LIRR.The venue has many entrances and is easy to get in and get out....Doesn't take nearly as long to be seated as Madison Square Garden
4,"We visited a New York Islanders game against the Pittsburg Penguins in mid march.Bought our tickets at vivid seats, which was much cheaper than on ticketmaster for this event. I paid only 33 dollars for 2 tickets in section 206, row 16. The view was very good from our seats. The Islanders played very good that evening and won 4:1. A lot of empty seats, only about 11.000 visitors that day. The Arena was very clean, restrooms not crowded. Easy exit after the game back to the subway to Manhattan.The prices for food and drinks are insane."
5,Cheaper than maddison square gardens to watch ice hockey and only a short subway ride from central new york. Expensive inside so maybe have a drink and meal before you go. Great atmosphere! Now big fans of islanders
3,Basketball stadium for concerts too. I didnt really like those sport things but kids will.Shops nearby were boring except for vegan soups expensive applebees upstairs across rd not my cup of tea there either.
5,I really enjoy Brooklyn and love this arena its small enough to see the artist or game and still big enough
1,"This center was built by wealthy investors who forced longtime residents out, shamelessly (and wrongly) using eminent domain."
4,Pretty nice but not as upscale feel as the recently renovated Madison Square Gardens. Upper seats are extremely steep. Arena is typical of the new indoor arenas. People get in and out fast. Conveniently located on subway line from Manhattan. Definitely would come back here.
5,Although its new in comparison to the Botanic Gardens. Its my got  to stadium if I'm planning on seeing a game.
4,"Went and watched a Brooklyn nets and Chicago bulls game here as we wanted to watch a game whilst on holiday here! Queuing was relatively easy and stress free, and I like how there’s lots of entertainment on the breaks!"
5,"To get through the control check was quite quick, same it was with buying a beer, so no wasting time in lines, good organization.Match was great, lot of goals, lot of fun, we enjoyed."
4,"Honestly, besides being a great game ( vs. Hurricanes), the stadium is huge and were the first arena with a candy store in my life."
5,Barclays Center was easy walk from subway. Great seats anywhere you sit. Easy to get in and out. Lots of eateries nearby. Easy walk from Prospect Park.
5,It’s nice I’m here for a basketball game. Sound system is good. It’s cold in here if you ask me so bring a hoodie or something I would revisit here
4,Good venue with excellent security which is essential these days. Well organised staff. Place has great atmosphere when full . Clear vision from all areas for onlookers.
4,I was having a great time with friends and the family when we went to a concert and the sound was awful. But with some complaints and no one wanting bad reviews they were happy to accommodate myself and my daughter with another free concert. I really appreciate all they have done.
5,"So glad we made the effort to make our trip to New York unforgettable, The Ed Sheeran divide tour was on at the Barclays our second last night. Easy venue to get to and only a few minutes walk to the station, crowd control was great, security was a breeze.We got good seats, front row on the 2nd level up, seats were comfortable, plenty of room. The access to toilets , food and drink was excellent. getting out of the concert was easy as, not like where we live. Well done, a very well run outfit."
5,Arena was easy to get into and despite the huge queues was very efficient at getting everyone in on time.  Facilities were varied for food and drinks.  As was the souvenir stand.  Had good views from our seats and was thoroughly entertained by the WWE event.
5,"Whilst visiting New York last month, we decided to watch an Islanders game at the Barclays Center. We booked our tickets online before and we were really impressed by the ease at which we were taken through security and finding our seats. A great family environment and so many food outlets that there was never much of a queue. We had a great afternoon!"
5,We have seen a few different shows here and never a bad seat.  Staff is on point and everything is priced as expected for an arena..
5,The rangers visited the Barclays last month and sat right behind the king. Even though we lost it’s a nice arena to see a game.
2,Hopefully the ACC will not choose this venue again for a long time....$6 for a bottle of water?  That a gouge even by New York standards....
3,"We attended the ACC Tournament.  The Center is conveniently located for subway access.  And there are many restaurants in the neighborhood.  Since it is relatively new, it is very nice inside.  As one can imagine, the concessions are very expensive for college basketball.  The staff was pleasant."
4,"I was in attendance for a basketball game.  The cleanliness of the venue was wonderful. The bathrooms were very clean.  The usher staff was amazing helpful and friendly.  I had a security issue with another guest and the security staff was very helpful.The concession prices were high, but they are high at all sports venues."
5,The Barclay Center was a dreaded addition to my neighborhood but it turned out to be most welcome. Its a well designed venue.
3,"I went for an Islanders game earlier this week to find this building is definitely not designed for hockey, nor really for the upper level to be used.The building definitely looks new and modern from the outside, but on the inside, the trip up the escalator to the upper levels showed suites that were abandoned both by staff and spectators. A total four overpriced concession stands for the upper level is clearly inadequate and gives fans an inferior experience. I've never seen a beer cost as much as it does there.The areas of corridor on the upper level that aren't concessions are dark and narrow.Fans clearly knew very little about hockey and I've never been to a hockey game where there were so few fans in the building that I had two spare seats next to me for my coat and those of the group next to me. Having checked Ticketmaster before the game to see if there were seats left, those two were marked occupied, what a shame.The video board hangs over a blue line rather than over centre ice and an entire end of lower bowl seating is occupied by sponsorship rather than seating. I've watched games televised from Barclay's and seen games shot from same blue line rather than centre ice. Clearly this was part of how the building was adapted for hockey.Poor sightlines and blocked views. I've heard better atmosphere at AHL games. No wonder this is the poorest attendance in the NHL, I feel terrible for the players. Standard security at the door, don't bring stuff with you that you don't need.One pro is the convenience of transit nearby, MTA and LIRR providing plenty of options."
3,"If you have good seats, then it is enjoyable.  The nosebleeds are awful because the seats are steep.  There are a lot of shows offered.  It is a modern arena.  It's ok."
4,Visiting from the UK we had tickets in section 204 what which was quite high up but the view was still good.   Very efficient in terms of getting in and out and the nearby subway was great to get back to our Manhattan hotel.  Food and drink overpriced but it always is in these venues.
4,"A new addition for the sports fan and entertainment industry. The Brooklyn Nets and Hockey Islanders are the main attractions in addition to a concert on occasion. The arena is new and built specific for Basketball with Hockey having problems with obstructed seats and ice quality. Good for a concert. Like any NYC arena, prices are steep and food and drink puts the bill over the top. Parking is a nightmare and mass transit the way to go. Before or after the game a local watering hole is fun and plenty to be had."
4,"Well, I grew up in NYC so I was interested in seeing what the Barclays Area would bring to Brooklyn. I was there for the Jay-Z concert which was great. However, I found the arena to be a little dark for my taste. The workers in the area also appear to be anxious. Not sure why this was, but they were. At that time, I also visited the 40-40 club which was very trendy. But I was not pleased with the food selection at all, other than the sliders. More recently, I visited for a class trip. For this trip, the workers were very patient and appeared to be more at ease. I work right down the block from the Barclays so my biggest issue is the crowd control for concerts. Otherwise, I do go to the arena for class trips and other events."
5,"Went to watch the nets for my 1st NBA game. The atmosphere was bouncing, we had a great time. The game helped as it went to overtime twice and the place was going crazy with each play"
2,"The Barclays Center was average. The employees were helpful but I thought a little disorganized. The bathroom was smelly and dirty at the beginning of the night.  It was my first visit and I was there for the Ladies Night R&amp;B Super Jam concert. The line up was great. However, again at the beginning the sound crew was having a problem within the first half hour which was not fair to the performers or the people who paid their money.. The sound problem persisted throughout the night. A big fail... If the sound crew is getting paid and cannot do a good job to insure that the performers can be heard.. What's the point? Fix the issue with the sound. I felt the performers deserved better and they weren't treated with the respect they deserved. I'm going to give Barclays Center one more try but if it fails I won't return and stick with Madison Square Garden or NJ venue's..."
3,"Was my first time seeing a nets basketball game in person. Was great seats and a really good game. I would definitely go back for a basketball game, but will stick to my concerts in Jersey."
4,Went to a Nets and Islanders game within days of each other. Completely different vibe at both events. Easy enough to get to from Manhattan and the staff were generally pleasant and helpful when you needed them.
4,"Had a wonderful time at a few games.We traveled by Subway each time because there is a “stop” right near the entrance.Food is Surprisingly good, Especially if you Purchase an All you can eat Package"
4,"We are from Pittsburgh and have a new state of the art hockey arena so the standard is fairly high. We sat in the second row from the ice and had a great vantage point of the action. Apparently this venue is also used for basketball so the ice quality is not the greatest. That was evident in the puck movement. Also, oddly, the cup holders at the seats are too big to hold a beer can, it falls right through."
5,Had the pleasure of visiting this venue for an NBA Nets game pre Christmas. Great place and easy access from the Metro. Seats were comfortable and the arena itself was wonderful. Only negative was the food and drink offerings were highly priced. $12 for a beer... take it or leave it. I left it unfortunately.
4,"I’ve gone to many concerts here. I don’t recommend sitting up high. It is very steep and you feel like you are going to fall. There are good places to eat nearby on 5th Ave in Parkslope.Parking is next to impossible, but you can take the train. Atlantic Ave is right there, so many trains are available."
1,I knew it would be overpriced but my god it was just a pee take. I thought I was going to have a heart attack the cost of 2 hot dogs and 2 coke $33 ... I know to eat before I go next time
5,"Went to see the Islanders play the Ducks, excellent venue with super facilities.. puts pretty much every similar venue in the UK and Europe to shame. Only gripe was the cost of beer ($10 a throw) and food."
5,"We visited the Barclays Centre in September where we saw Paul McCartney. We walked to the venue from the Time Square area since we wanted to explore Manhattan and walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, which was a very lengthy walk but doable! If you are staying in Manhattan and wanting to walk the Bridge and then head to the Barclays Center, the Centre is only a few blocks away from the Bridge. The venue has very close access to the Subway, making it convenient to transfer to and from it safely. As for the Concert, the arena had amazing sound and you had great visibility from any seat in the house. We chose to see the concert at this venue over Madison Square as the tickets were substantially cheaper and you get way better seats for the same price you would pay to sit in the nosebleeds at Madison. If a concert you are seeing has the options of Madison Square and Barclays, I would 100% choose Barclays if sitting closer to the stage/more intimate concert is an important aspect for you. I hope to be back someday to experience more events!"
5,"Venue was great. Subway station literally right in front of the venue. Awesome!!! So convenient. I saw there were several options for vehicles as well. The venue is big, the crowd control was a bit non existent before entering the concert. A little more control of people cutting in line and order would be nice. Once inside; you have plenty of drink, food options. Many vendors. The place has good surround sound and can accommodate a nice size crowd. Fun concert!!!"
5,"Great place to go for any event, went for Nets game and it was amazing! Food options are great! If your able to get the all access ticket is a must, which allows you to eat unlimited within the entire arena."
5,We watched a Nets game here. It was quite  cool ambiance. You can easily access the place. Dont bring a big bag since it is not allowed to take in.
4,"New arena with a easy way to get to, nice and service minded staff. Seats are ok, better when you a seated at 100 sec. Food is ok lots to chose to, beers $16 or 13,50 for a can Bud!!!!. Nets and Islanders did gave us nice evening."
4,I had pretty good seats so it was nice and the experience was as well. You wouldn't think its a hockey arena from the outside
5,"A great view from the seats we had in 2nd tier.  Remember it’s an ice rink so wrap up warm.Tasty burger and fries. You can’t take in your own drinks, even soft drinks or water and they are around $6 inside.  There are free water fountains though!"
4,We visited the Barclays Center to watch an NBA game. Stuff were helpful and polite. There are various choices to eat. Chairs were comfortable and view is quite good even if top rows (cheaper tickets) are quite away from court.
1,"Took my 9 year old son to see 2 Islanders games here whilst on holiday from the UK.The seats were poor, hardly any leg room for an adult.The cost of food and drink is ridiculously high, $13 for a Coke and $7 for a small bottle of water...I needed to check if my travel insurance covered heart attacks.The choice of food was poor and again far too expensive and about half of food service points were open limiting choice.I also took my son to the Prudential Center to watch the NJ Devil's, far better experience, doors open 90 mins before face off, far greater choice of food and drink and not as costly as Barclays Center.I like the Islanders but would not return to see them at the Barclays Center."
4,"On a recent visit to New York we decided to book tickets to see some ice hockey. Madison square garden tickets cost silly money so we went to see the New York Islanders at the Barclays centre. The journey from our Times Square hotel via the subway was very straightforward and we stepped out right outside the arena. Before going in we went into the models sport shop where my two daughters (19 and 22) bought official replica shirts. They were able to buy size large boys which were half the price of adult shirts and then received a further 15% discount at the till because we were going to the game. On arriving at the centre we found a large queue waiting to enter as the doors don't open until one hour before the match starts. As I had a backpack we were directed to another queue at the back of the building with extra security checks, this had about 10 people in it !!! Despite the extra security we were inside very quickly. Once inside, the building is very modern and well signposted. The only negative thing was the price of refreshments which in my view were extortionate, however the locals seemed to be buying quite happily. The seats we bought were excellent and exactly as shown on the website when we bought them. The whole experience was excellent and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who wants to experience a major American  sporting event in a very comfortable arena. A lack of knowledge of ice hockey and it's rules will not stop you enjoying this event."
4,Went to an Islanders game. Nice arena with good food and drink options. Our seats were first row and upper bowl. Good view for the game.
4,"13 Celtics fans were happy to see their team win, but were even HAPPIER to start the night off at Parma, the restaurant at one end of the Barclays Center where, with a reservation, you can eat, drink, AND enjoy a view of the game for as long as you want.  Celebrating two birthdays that weekend, staff provided each girl with a beautiful assortment of desserts, along with an ice cream cake to share with everyone.  Three of us ordered the $50 buffet, which is open until halftime and is HUGE, clean, and delicious.  If you have an appetite, this is definitely worth it.  I'm sure eating out in the arena you could easily spend $50 on junk!  Staff pushes the buffet, but those of us with smaller appetites ate off the menu, which had small entrees at a heftier price; I'd go with the sandwiches instead, and I particularly did NOT like the fra diavolo.  Staff also warned us that ordering off the menu could take a long time, but we did NOT find that to be the case.  AND the CELTICS beat the Nets!  A birthday to remember :)"
4,"Went to a Brooklyn Nets game - way cheaper than going to see the Knicks in Manhattan. Only 25 mins by subway to the arena.  Alcohol is not cheap there, a large can of beer was $16, match tickets was $32 approx.Result was a win for the home team so a good night!"
3,"I've been to this venue for concerts and for Islander hockey games.  The staff is almost always courteous and helpful, the concession stands offer a nice variety of food and drinks, and the common areas and bathrooms are adequate for events.  The issues I have are:- Poor hockey sight lines from one end of the arena due to seat overhang- Upper concourse common areas can get congested during intermissions due to a few bottlenecks at the corners of the arena.- Half the concession stands on the upper concourse are closed for hockey games, even games that are nearly sellouts.- For concerts, the sound is poor if you are on the side, best sound is directly in front of the stage."
4,This stadium is best for boxing and basketball. It's made specifically for those events so the vantage point s are good from everywhere. I hear concerts are good too.
4,"I have been here for Hockey, fights and concerts. All have been great. Many food choices. Staff has always been helpful. Sound is great. Getting out of the stadium is fast and smooth."
3,So I have dreamed of going to the Barclays Center ever since it opened.  I finally got the opportunity to get in there and was very disappointed.  After being in Yankee Stadium it was much smaller than I expected.  The people working there was not very friendly.  That probably was what made it not so nice.
4,We went to the show. The seats we had were easily accessible. Everything that was available for sale were at a reasonable price.
5,"I went to a Brooklyn Nets game here and the arena is fantastic with great atmosphere, easy to enter and exit and the live sport experience here with music / dancers is great"
5,"Visited Barclary Center from Manhattan on subway to see New York Islanders, it is around three stops after Brooklyn Bridge subway junction so easy to get to.Having previously visited Madison Square Garden for New York Rangers, I was really really impressed by the closeness of the lower tier seating to the action, the atmospshere of the stadium, the extra entertainment between periods of play, the attitude and warmth of the Ice Hockey fans (and our daughter appeared three times on the internal TV screens dancing, chearing and supporting the Islanders!)Thoroughly recommend visiting Barclay Centre over Madison Square Garden, even if the subway is slightly longer - it is literally just outside the subway station - the wait was definately worthwhile and it is a great venue for families."
5,"What a memorable night, bucket list worthy!  Go if you can, when the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame does their inductions here. (every other year).Take a cab, no parking, but killer sound and not a bad seat in the house!"
3,"This is a great arena for amenities and easy to get to from the subway, however I am giving Barclay’s a 3* for hockey games only. This arena is likely awesome for other events. Be careful buying Islanders tickets as many seats have obstructed views."
4,"Looks and feels as new as the day it opened. A great deal of pride here. Nice people. The entertainment within the breaks of the game was nice but when they use the t-shirt guns there are only 2 that I could see...@ Amway Arena in Orlando they have 10 shooters on all the levels, gets the crowd more into it...also no mascot on the floor to keep the crowd in it..lighting is incredible focused on the floor really great..Brooklynettes, drum team and acrobats &amp; dancers during breaks are really talented, It just needs a spark to put it over the top.."
5,"This place is great for sporting events, concerts and other events like a circus. And when you finish here you can go across the street and shop til you drop. Great combination!"
5,"This stadium in Brooklyn is next to the subway making access a breeze. The staff are helpful and friendly. The complex is clean and cheerful. The only down side, the food is horrendously expensive - 3 cokes, $28!  Bring your own  and sneak it in."
5,I´ve been there last October to see a Brooklyn Nets and Denver game. It was amazing. Great place. Comfortable and safe. Full of places tu buy something to drink or eat.
4,"Saw Wilder vs Stiverne 2. Whilst it was still brilliant, I wish it had lasted longer! Great venue though, would love to return."
5,"World class arena, easy to get to from centre of Manhattan, great seats comfy plenty of legroom. We had a great game 10 goals in all, reasonably priced tickets!!"
5,"My sister, nephew and I attended a concert at the Barclays Center! It was really nice and pretty! The sound system was excellent!"
5,"I loved my experience in the Barclays Center. The place was full of good vibes, great music and it was lots of fun. Unfortunately, the Nets lost... but they were close! And that is the magic, isn't it?"
4,"My brother, cousin, nephew and myself attended the Barcleys Center Classic on 25 November 2017. The venue is centrally located and is easily accessible by mass transit. Be advises parking is hard to find! The seating is standard for most sporting arenas; hard and small, however, all the seat have unimpeded views of the court. The food is priced at standard arena prices, and the variety and quality is not that great.  I suggest you visit The DeKalb Market Hall before coming to Barclays!The highlight of the day was the match of #25 Alabama versus #14 Minnesota. The game was the wildest I've ever seen!All in all, I rate the venue an 8 out of 10 for basketball games."
3,"Arena was nice and clean but seats for hockey not to good unless you are down on the ice, good food/ drink choices"
5,"We went to see Hov in the Barclay Center Nov 27 , 2017 . We sat on the floor what an amazing time we had  . The place is amazing and comfortable !"
4,"Been to the Barclays Center for 2 nets games, got tickets through a very close relative, so we were able to visit the free food area before the game.Seats were ok, a little smaller then the garden, since I’m a Rangers and Knicks fan. Go early otherwise going through security could be time consuming."
4,"More of a review on Disney Dare to Dream than Barclay center.Had a nice mix of older Princesses  Cinderella, Belle then Rapunzel, Elsa and Moana   It was nicely done, under two hours which is important when you have little ones.  As usual the food at Barclays was overpriced  $12 for a soda/souvenir cup.   Whereas the $12 for popcorn came in a nice little Disney mini tote and good sized bag of Popcorn so happy with Disney concessions just not Barclays"
4,Was worried when we read reviews about bad ice hockey here but we had no issues and had a great night! Especially the ritual for when the team scores! Saw the NY Islanders vs Arizona Coyotes and was lots of fun!
1,"When going through security we had a women and a man search us,  the man searched my bag which included a E-cig, lighter and e-liquid nothing was said. My boyfriend came through and the women took his e'cig opened it up and said there not allowed i told her it was just a e-cig and she said there banned,the liquid went on her hands then moaned thatll itll cause irratation. My boyfriend had to hide half of his e'cig outside but was allowed to keep the battery part. When inside watching the boxing, two men four rows in front was smoking there e-cig!!! How is it that some get theres took off them yet some get through and also smoke it??? Dont understand why e-cigs are not allowed and if this is the case then PUT this on tickets so when buying your aware and you dont get things chucked or wasted like she wasted the liquid!!!"
5,"We took our daughter to Katy Perry concert here.We took the subway from the city and were a little bit worried about finding our way to the venue. We were pleasantly surprised to find that you literally walk up to it from the subway station!The staff that did the crowd control were really nice and friendly. We got in without hassles. Each seating cluster is designed so that there is easy access to restrooms and vendors. We let our young daughter walk up and out and buy merchandise all by herself!The only downside, food and drinks are a bit overpriced."
2,"While the place has a descent seating area for a concert, And you're not going for the food However if your hungry i will say it is by far the worst food for a venue of that size I've ever been too... we tried the pizza the hamburgers the chicken fingers all terrible and good luck if you just want a water too wash it down at 6 bucks a pop.. and not only are all the choices tasteless but omg overpriced as well .. do your self a favor get a bite too eat before at shake shack directly across the street or eat before you go to a show there .."
5,Visited the Barclays centre with my wife and children to see the Brooklyn Nets vs Cleveland cavs. It’s a great venue! We sat in a corner but the view was great! Great atmosphere during the game! Food and drinks a tad expensive!
5,"So, holidaying in NY, staying in Brooklyn and hear about ice hockey in the Barclays Centre.....another first for me. I assume this venue is home to the NY Islanders team? But the event is just so much more than an ice hockey game; it’s a hugely rewarding experience, and very much a family night out. Real entertainment and spectator entertainment from entering the arena until you leave. This is a superb modern venue with great acoustics and sound systems. I would imagine whatever event is hosted here, spectators will enjoy a great time. We loved it!"
4,Take the subway out to Coney Is. A short walk from the station &amp; easy to walk along . See the ocean and lots of people in summer
4,"Been here twice but last time we saw the New York Islanders ice hockey team and it was fantastic.Also did basketball which I enjoyed but ice hockey is just mad.It's a much cheaper option than going to Madison Square Garden and if you do want to go I would recommend not pre booking tickets or even doing it at your hotel, just jump on the subway the day before and buy the tickets at the ticket office, it's really easy and you will save so much money, plus you get to go to Brooklyn and if your feeling energetic you can walk back to Manhatten over the Brooklyn Bridge, it will take about 3/4 hr but worth it.Also if you go to a game there and use the subway it's worth buying a metro card, they are cheap and you will save money on each journey, but also you can walk straight into the station and although there's a queue you just go straight through the turnstiles to the platform."
5,"We love visiting different arenas and catching NBA games in other cities. We had the opportunity to see the Nets season opener from great seats in the corner. Ticket prices were quite reasonable since the Nets aren't expected to have a great season. A bonus is there are small rows in the corner that mean groups can have their own row. Me and the missus were able to sit together with nobody on either side of us, and just one row in front of us. The view was perfect with comfortable seats. The only other arena I've been to with a similar seating layout was Oracle Arena in Oakland.Our only complaint was the concession prices. I understand (and usually accept) the higher prices in arenas, stadiums, and theme parks. It's part and parcel of the experience. This was unbelievable. We spent $54 for two individual pizzas and two large Cokes. If I hadn't already placed the order, I wouldn't have spent the money. All that aside, I strongly recommend the Barclays Center. The building design, layout, and atmosphere are truly top notch. If the Nets return to winning ways, this will be one of the best places to see an NBA game."
2,"Acoustics was very bad 4 years ago at the Alicia Keys concert.I'm sure it's much better to watch a game there, but then they should not bring music to that place."
3,This is my 1st visit to the Barclays  Center. It is not a bad place to see a game. Prices for food and drink are very high. But that is the norm at a sports venue in NYC. Overall it wasn't a bad experience.
3,The Barclays center is a great place to watch basketball or a concert but the hockey set up is questionable at best. There are quite a few sections with abstructed views so be sure to do your research before purchasing Islanders tickets. The venue has wide hallways and large restrooms which makes for a comfortable game day experience. There are plenty of food/drink options and lines aren't too long. The arena is easily accessible by subway or rail.  This is a must visit if your in downtown BK.
5,Easy to get in and out. Plenty of food and drink facilities with in the center.Seats had plenty of room and very clean.
5,"Worth visiting to see sports or performances. Saw a hockey game there and graduation and had wide open halls, good food selection, (pricey) and steep seating. Not for people with unsteady gait or canes for reserved seats unless you indicate handicap on you tickets."
5,"Saw Katy Perry here during the week. Great acoustics and good layout.Seating was good. Plenty of food options, if a little pricey. However, this is not uncommon for enclosed venues.Great concert!"
4,Very helpful staff. Quick in and out. Food and drink prices horrendous. Only thing that stopped 5 stars really.
5,"Went to see Ed Sheeran which was brilliant. Great arena, very well managed and clean and staff are very pleasant and helpful unlike some other arenas which I won’t mention here."
5,It is nice that Brooklyn now has a premium venue to compete with MSG. Barclays has a youthful staff who make you feel welcome and are very helpful. The venue gets world class entertainment and NBA teams.
4,"As a ""Brooklynite"" I love walking to events at the Barclay. The place is well designed and albeit not recommended for vertigo sufferers, most seats have good views of the stage. We have been there for children events, fantastic concerts and even graduations and through all experiences, the Barclays is a winner. The staff are superb, very accommodating and well trained.  Perhaps, my only qualm is that I would like to see more events being offered throughout the year. We want more Barclays!!!"
5,I went to see Ed Sheeran here with my teenaged niece.  I thought it was so very convenient to get off the subway just steps from the entrance. The seats were quite comfortable. It was very easy to get in and out of the venue as well.  I’m not sure the acoustics were so great but that could have been the performer’s set up?I do think that security could be stepped up a lot in these challenging days of crazy people targeting large gatherings. No one seemed too concerned about doing a real thorough search of my bag. Maybe they will do a better job after the tragedy in Vegas.
4,"Really impressive arena and NHL tickets much cheaper than Madison Square Garden. Well worth a visit, but beer, drinks and food is extortionate."
5,In town for a concert. Getting in the center is easy. Finding our seats was easy. the seats were really narrow and uncomfortable. Didn't make sitting there for 3 hours easy.  Would i go again? Maybe...I like the neighborhood and i love seeing live music. Leaving after concert was easy... glad we had to walk a bit to stretch  our legs.
3,"I recently attended a concert at the Barclays Center with family. There were 4 of us attending and we traveled all the way from Albany for the event. This was my first time visiting this venue and I was excited to experience this concert in this venue. I had purchased tickets online and being afraid of heights, I knew not to get 200 level seats due to how steep they were and various reviews I read prior to purchasing tickets. The map I looked at when making my purchase made the seats I did in fact purchase look a bit lower than other sections within the 200's. I chose the seats I did because we did not have to walk up a number of steep stairs to get to our seats. There were 2 rows where we were and 2 steps to the concourse exit. I thought that shouldn't be bad....wrong. Immediate panic attack (which I should have known better with 200 level). The seats we had were in section 210 Row 1. There was glass in front of us, but it was low and if you are afraid of heights doesn't do much for your relief. I asked customer services if I could possibly be moved to another location due to my fear. They said they would see what they could do. In the meantime, I asked the usher in our section if I could possibly sit in an area to the side on a set of stairs that were not being used. He made me feel like a crazy person for being so scared and told me to basically deal with it. I was ready to leave the arena at this point. I could not sit in those seats. Finally, customer service did move us to another section on a platform. Only 2 of the 4 of us could move our seats, which was fine. We ended up on the wheelchair platform where the area was flat and not slanted. There were some speakers blocking the screen behind the stage, but that was fine. The usher in this area was extremely nice although at one point of the show, a drunk obnoxious guy came onto our platform and screamed in my ear out of nowhere. We went to one of the concession stands on the 200 level to purchase popcorn, but they were out. That was a bummer. Typical high prices for drinks. $6 water! $13 beers. You will have that at any arena though. Overall, it was a good venue.......if you have floor or 100 level seats. Staff could be a bit friendlier, but customer service was very accommodating to me as I was having a panic attack. Next time I will get lower level seats."
5,"This wonderful, relatively new center is currently a crown jewel of Brooklyn  We have been to great concerts as well as sports events and I see kids line up for special events for them.  Subway stop RIGHT IN FRONT. Could not t be easier. Food options are fabulous as are all the ushers and service people.  Great new addition for Brooklyn"
3,"Came here for the Roger Waters show.CONS: Security entrance was a disaster. What knucklehead thought this was a best practice!?Hundreds of people were kept back in one large crowd behind a barricade that was approx. 40 yards from the main entrance. They had 2 barricade points that they would crack open to let in 25 or so people in at a time to get to the metal detectors. So you had a pushing match of people squeezing in to a 4 foot opening while some knucklehead from security yelled, do not push. .Safety! Are you kidding? Anyone ever think of roped off lines to the doorways? It took us 45 minutes to get in once we got to the barricade entrance. Still had to go through detectors.Seating is hit or miss. We had good seats at an awkward angle. Forget about sitting up top. Those seats are horrible. If you have vertigo or are afraid of heights, Don't Do It!Pros: Sound was VG. Clear and magnified.Train to the Center is very easy from NYC or Brooklyn....and I would guess other boroughs as well.Not my first go to arena, but I would go back for the right concert."
2,"As an experienced NBA fan, I've already been to some of the best arenas in the US. And when I say best, I mean the whole package: seats, staff, prices, costumer services and etc. I've been to there in January to watch the visiting Spurs take on the Nets, the home team. I knew it would be a rough night the moment I knew Coach Pop would rest top dog Khawi Leonard and fan favorite Manu Ginobili. Paul Gasol and Tony Parker were also out due to injuries and didn't even travel to Brooklyn. The Nets would relay only on lonely star Brook Lopez. But none of this is Barclays Center's fault. The following will be. Firstly, the access is very uncomfortable. I had near courtside tickets for me and my wife, but had to enter through the small side doors as the employees took too long to clear the lines, leaving lots of people getting wet and cold outside (it was a raining night). Then came my time to be checked. An employee looked at my bag and found a DSLR camera used in both Madison Square Garden (Knicks' arena) and Verizon Center (Wizards arena) a week earlier. I was taken to a consumer service where the employee told me I couldn't take my camera with me to the game because it had attachable lens. I told her I used the very same equipment for games in NY and DC, but couldn't change her mind. Not even when I told her I was a Brazilian tourist and that I wouldn't be there every night to get another shot of taking pictures of the game. She told me ""it is the policy"" and did the same to a boy with a board. C'mon... I then entered the arena and when I got to my seat, I wanted to take a picture (with my cellphone) as close as possible to the court, as my tickets gave the chance to do it. When my wife was preparing to shoot, a very inconvenient employee got to me and told me to seat. I know it's a NBA rule not to do it as the game is underway. But I tried to get a picture BEFORE the game got started. By that time I was very UPSET. I spent US$ 130 on each seat for not being able to have some fun. When the game started, the employee kept harassing people in timeouts. You just couldn't move or he would come at you. Very disturbing. I took a photo ""with"" him and attached it to this review. And somewhere in the second quarter, a man showed in the audience shooting photographs with a DSLR just like mine. I attached a photo of him also in this review. Then I got back to the consumer service to try to recover the right to use my camera. Told the same woman what happened, but she got off and told me she wouldn't give it back until the end of the game. I had nothing like it in any other arena. In halftime, I went out to buy something to eat. And then it just got worse: if you wanted a special Nets cup souvenir filled with soda, you'd have to pay US$ 11 (it was 9 in NY and 7 in DC). Too expensive!!! And for eating, other few expensive options. The game was boring because it was already a blowout by the start of the 3rd quarter. At the end, I got my camera back and tried to take pictures of the common areas of the arena. As I prepared to shoot, another employee appeared from nowhere and told me to stop 'cause it was forbidden. C'mon! US$ 130 and you just can't do anything. No pics at all???? Never seen a place as prohibitive as this place. Shame on you Barclays Arena staff! I thought NBA games were all about fun, like the other arenas I'm used to visit. Even in the NFL things are more fun. Barclays Arena is just awful. Brooklyn fans deserved better! I'm not coming back. Period."
5,"Had a great time watching the Brooklyn Nets (despite the team sucking), very easy access trough the subway from Manhattan, would definitely come back."
5,I think the arena was very nice. There was a nice shopping center just across the road. Getting there was easy the subway was just next to it. From the arena to Union Square was around 30 min. Very convenient if you don't really know your way around.
3,We went to go see the ringling brothers last year and had a great time. The seats were comfortable and there were good choices for food...The only downside was there was a brawl in the hallway after the show and there were not enough security staff. Didn't see any cops in the vicinity even though it was such a big event. Was quite scary since we were with kids
4,"Big, for ca 20,000 people, well planned, good acoustics and also easy to access with public and private transportation.Went there for the Roger Waters concert last night, really great!"
5,"Spent a lot of time at this stadium for high school graduation, college graduation, and Nets games. They keep it rather cool inside, but that's pretty normal with stadiums. Love that it's close to Atlantic Mall and walking distance from my home."
5,We booked tickets for 26th December to see Brooklyn Nets. Easy to get to &amp; felt very safe. Had planned to see the Knicks at MSG but ticket prices were extortionate.We had never seen basketball before but we all loved it &amp; thought the crowd was great. Also helped that we won in final seconds. Great night. A one off which I highly recommend.
5,"Easy to get here by subway.Awesome venue, great employees. Clean restrooms.Lots of food choices.Seats are rather tight.Larger patrons may feel squished.Don't get a seat high in the arena if you have a problem with heights .No bad views, but the suspended lighting contraption is a bit distracting. The large screens are crystal clear and you almost prefer them.Choose your seat wisely if you don't like getting up and down for hungry folks. Some people  needed to eat three times and go to the restroom two times during the event There was a special line for wheelchair and cane walking folks, to avoid being pushed when the doors opened.Don't know too much about parking options or how crowded the train was after the event."
4,While in NY city it happened that WWE summerslam was on. Firstly getting to Barclays centre is superb. Subway takes you literally to the front door and you can take many trains to get u there. Entry I thought was good as we had platinum tickets which got us in nice and quick. As with all venues security took a bit of time but I have no problem with this.  Seats at the arena all seem to give you a good view and we had great seats. Event lends itself very well to the the event and you could get out get food / go to toilet very quickly as you don't want to miss anything. Again getting home / out of the venue was very smooth.
5,"Booked tickets and flew from the UK to be at the New York show of Queen's American 2017 tour, and loved every single second of it. The venue itself is very nice and cool which on the day I went it was 30 degrees outside...it was extremely hot! No problems getting my tickets at the will-call desk since I booked them when I was at home in England, and the staff were very accommodating. Merch stands were well maintained and well managed by people clambering to get some tour t-shirts and if your like me buying things in different sizes for people as souvenirs back home!"
2,"We were on vacation in New York with the WWE in town we thought we would attend the great show the McMahon family deliver. The arena had stricter security than 9/11, JFK airport, Yankee Stadium, The Met Life Stadium or any other major attraction we visited in New York. We attended large numbers of sporting and entertainment events In London and have not seen such scrutiny. In addition not being able to bring drinks or food in to the arena in tempratures in the 90s outside and charging $6 for a bottle of water or $11 for soda is taking advantage of guests. Would not choose to go there again."
3,"Came here for 3 nights in August for 3 different WWE shows.First off, this location is easy to each from Times Square. About 20 minutes on the Q subway, straight out the station at the impressive looking Barclays Center hits you.On two nights I sat in the 100 level and had a cracking view, well worth sitting anywhere in this level. I have also sat in these sections in previous years and have no complaints.One night I sat high up in the 200's and boy is it high up there! Way to steep and you actually felt like you would fall towards the ring when you stood up. The sound and acoustics are not as loud up here either. Good views but nowhere near as good as lower down and a bit of a health hazard.Staff are overall friendly, although one night the arena was late letting us in so most of the crowd missed the first match. Security is excellent as adequate measures are taken.The price of food and beer is pretty extortionate. Beer was $13, the highest I have ever seen at a venue. Small cokes were $6 and they were small to say the least.Overall good venue, great transport links, modern but could do with improvements higher up and cheaper food and drink options."
4,"Whether you're a Nets/Islanders fan or enjoy a concert or 3, Barclays Center is an amazingly constructed &amp; stylish Entertainment Arena. Very easy to get to via the Subway, (get off at Atlantic Terminal Mall stop) whether your starting point is Union Station, Times Square or somewhere closer. And located in the vibrant district of Brooklyn where Atlantic Ave meets Flatbush Ave, so you know there's a gallery of shops &amp; restaurants nearby (I recommend Shake Shack across the street) for you to add to your Barclays experience."
5,Went to watc Summerslam 2017 and had a magnificent experience. Very easy to get to from Manhattan as you only need the Q train which stops you directly in front of the same arena!
2,"One star because some, but not all , of the employees acted with integrity.One star because the venue is nice lookingAnd that is all.I went to Summerslam 2017 on August 20, 2017.*First, they started allowing people in at 5:00 PM, WHICH IS WHEN THE PRESHOW STARTED, thereby forcing everyone to miss at least some of the pre-show. Perhaps I should consider a class action suit to recover funds for EVERYONE, for forced loss of service.* Second, they opened only a few entrances, thereby causing a slow entry process and a crowd density problem ( there must have been at least 5000 people waiting to get in). * Third, no regular drink cups at some of the concessions ( from early on), thereby requiring those who needed a drink to buy the ""souvenir cup"" at $5.00 more.* Fourth, the concession table condiments DID NOT WORK, NONE OF THEM.OH, and a permanent aspect of the venue: The aisles are ridiculously narrow. This is a safety risk, and everyone complains about it.All in all, a miserable reflection on those who were in charge of venue logistics."
5,"had a awesome time, seats weren't the best .... but that was my fault enjoyed my time... would do it again"
1,"This was my 2nd time to Barclay Center. I have to say I will not be back. The concert was phenomenal. The venue poor. From the lack of LIRR trains traveling to Atlantic terminal, the mass chaos trying to get in the center(no organization whatsoever) to the food closing down by 9pm.  The list could go on. I would have to say I am surprised people go thereMuch needed organization and they need proficient staff."
1,Save your time and money.  This venue is not good for hockey.  If your an Islander fan see them else where.  Seems like they squeezed a square peg into a round hole.   Bad bad bad for hockey
4,"I went to J.Cole's ""4YEO"" tour at the Barclay Center, which was my first time being there and I really enjoyed it. The venue is nice and clean and pretty easy to find your way around. The concert was absolutely amazing and was really dope to see a concert of one my favorite artist in Brooklyn! It was super easy getting there as well. Where I was staying in Brooklyn, all I had to do was ride the R train for 3 stops and I was there. Overall good experience!"
5,"Huge place. Very comfortable to go out and chill the night . They have amazing concerts , or games playing there.."
3,"this arena was decent, we went to the lounge it was good a bit pricey . the chicken was good . the seats was good for seeing a boxing match."
4,Came here for two concerts and a few basketball games. It's very spacious and big in here. Many floors not really a problem to get in but when leaving the crowd in the train station is very large. The food here is pricy and they do not allow outside food or beverages. I prefer to go to the restroom during whatever I'm there to see or not at all because there will be a very long female line during intermission and after whatever I was there for finishes.
4,"Great venue! RIGHT OFF the train station, most convenient location ever!Went to see a Florence and the machine concert there. The place looks new , good food choices, would be better with a little more variety. Overall, enjoyed the concert . The location is the main thing that makes it so good. Would be back to see other concerts. 3.5 to 4 stars."
4,"I'm from Brooklyn so the commute for me is not an issue as, I've read from other reviewer's. We were there for a Shawn Mendes concert and my daughter had Q&amp;A tickets plus the concert . She and her friend were so excited and had a great time."
1,Horrible experience getting here and getting home. Will. Ever buy tickets here againDrive from hauppauge to Hicksville.  Take train to Jamaica. Wait 20 min at Jamaica. Train to Atlantic ave jammed wall to wall.  Hot.  Sweaty. Get to Brooklyn.  10000 people trying to cross a street.  What genius did t build a walkway to the stadiumTakes 15 minutes to go 2 blocks. Then you get the pleasure of waiting in a massive crowd. Total disorganization. No staff. To wait an hour to get in.  Insane.  After the concert it gets worse if you can believe it.     Trains are so packed it's like Tokyo.  So they tell u to go to another track. Sit on a train not moving for 30 min. With no AC.  Then takes an hour. No joke to get to minneola. Jammed at Jamaica. SitJammed at minneola sit
4,"Very good venue, good sound quality, nice architecture. Good, varied food options. Good amount of bathrooms. Good amount of space, doesn't feel crowded. I've found street parking close by on a weekday night. Friendly staff. No complaints."
5,"Its connected to a great subway/LIRR station.It has some great acts performing there, like Jay Z.Also, if you like hockey and basketball but want to actually see a professional game, come here and root for the underdogs - the New York Islanders and Brooklyn Nets. The seats are much more affordable than their Manhattan-based rivals."
5,"I was here for a conference and the center and its location couldn't be more perfect. The center was very spacious and very good at accommodating thousands of people. I didn't try any of their food from their vendors because just across the street there are hundreds of little bistros and restaurants you can go to in walking distance. So location overall is awesome when it comes to looking around the area.There is also a Starbucks connected to the center on the outside which is always packed but there are lots of patio seats for you to rest on after you purchase your drinks. Overall, this center seems like an awesome venue not only for conferences but concerts and anything else.It's arena is awesome! And the seats and center itself are the cleanliest I have ever been to! Do not hesitate for venues here."
4,It's good not great.  A few performances went too long. Not best venue but enjoyable.  Brazilian music and first part were the most notable.
3,"We were here for Cirque du Soleil OVO ( second time in this venue, first time was Toruk also Cirque du Soleil).  The Center is clean but kind of disorganized, once we get into, we went to the souvenir store and bought some magnets and T-shirts, but the people were kind of desperate, I actually had some words with a lady that she tried to cut the line on front of me. After the souvenir kiosko, we went to get some waters and hot dogs (you can not bring umbrellas, waters or food to the venue), so once we ordered some snacks, we were speechless, one bottle of water $6.00 and each Hot Dog $5.50.???..That was a ripped off..!!I I said... and the cashier sarcasticatly said to me “ Welcome to the Barclay Center”.. I asked for ketchup, mayo and mustard and she pointed me to the pump cart, we went there and not ketchup, mayo nor mustard were coming out, they forgot to filled it, I told a lady that was on the counter and she acted like I was bothering her, kind of rude, she brought me the ketchup and mustard squeeze bottle. About the show it was O.K, it wasn’t like other shows that I’ve been, this one was more for kids, the music was a mix of Brazilian Rhythm and Caribbean beat, good costumes designs, very colorful. About our seats, I made a mistake in booking our tickets on the floor ( Section F5 - Row 3- Seat 9-10 ), it was too close to the stage and we couldn’t enjoy the show the first hour cause the stage it  was a little higher and we had to keep our heads up to catch some glimpses of the show. After the intermission, I spoke with one of the usher to see if I can change our seat and she kindly relocated us right behind to the sound console, and honestly, the view was much better. We could see the floor and the show better."
5,This is an architectural gem - easily accessible by train or subway. Even good for concerts as well as sports
5,never had been to Brooklyn before. Was a neat place with great restaurants. we ate at Juniors restaurant. The food was good and a subway away to the Barclay Center.  Love loved our visit to the Barlclay Center. Big place.
5,"First time here - Loved the concert. (Iron Maiden) The sound was pretty decent. It was packed and the seating is a bit cramped when you sit high up. Also it was very, very warm in the arena - not sure why. The air was on but it didn't seem to help. It was 90 out earlier in the day so maybe that was a factor. I was glad I wore layers. The staff was very friendly and helpful though. Everything was organized and made getting in and out easy. I would recommend seeing a show here and I would go back."
4,Great arena for concerts. Easy to get to via the subway; there is a major station right at the venue. Quick entry. Only complaint is the price of food and drink. Way overpriced. Lots of pubs and bars in the area to get food and drink at half the price.
5,"This new stadium is what Brooklyn needed. It's perfectly made and you get a great view from any seat honestly. It's created a bigger downtown hub for BK. I've only gone for basketball games but they have many other events as well. The train station is located directly in front of the main entrance, which matching styles. Still would like to try out he 40/40 club or see Beyoncé! Haha"
3,The show was AMAZING but there NO organization getting in the show.. I'm not sure what was going on but it was horrible. I been to PLENTY of concerts/basketball games at the Barclays &amp; never had that problem.
4,"My wife and I have been to the Barclay Center twice - to see Smokey Robinson and to see Steve Wonder.  We're not fans of big venues like this, but this is our favorite of them. The Barclay Center provides an excellent experience. Entrance into the building is efficient and the guards are polite. The sound system is terrific.  There are large screens that project the stage in case you're far away. The pricing and food options are okay.  It can be a great place to see some of your favorite performers."
4,"I have been here for basketball, concerts and hockey.  As the arena was built for basketball and concerts, it has really nice sight lines.  Hockey is a mess and, it's probably a good thing that the Islanders are leaving!"
3,Nice stadium with good overview of the game even if you sit on the top rows! But it was overpriced and halv empty. Expected a little bit more out of it... anyways - Floyd mayweather was there which was cool!
2,"I never disliked an arena more than this one. It was made with profit in mind and no comfort whatsoever. The place is huge, the seats are so narrow and abrupt. I could not dance or move too much because you are hitting the person sitting/ standing next too you. If we did not have the rails of the entrance in front of us I felt we could fall at any time. And I wasn't in the last section. Maybe for the games is better but for concerts not. Sound was good."
1,The Barclays Center is a cool building to go to but not for a hockey game. The seating arrangement is awkwardly designed so depending on where you're sitting you might not be able to watch parts of the game. I sat in the corner where there's a huge section with no seats and a car was being shown and couldn't see anything on that side of the rink. It's like watching half a hockey game. It would be best if the Barclays center was ONLY for basketball but the Islanders should get a new rink with normal seating.
5,"Love coming to events here. The staff is always great, they are able to get you in and through security fast. The food choices are great even though they are a little pricey, it's what you have to expect at a place like this! Always clean too!"
4,"The games here are fun, but MAN OH MAN is the food overpriced.Something like $5 for a small Coke and $5 for a pretzel? Unreal."
5,"Best Babs concert ever …. The Barclays Center is a multi-purpose indoor arena in Brooklyn, NY. The arena is part of a $4.9   billion future business and residential complex now known as Pacific Park. The site is located at Atlantic Avenue, adjacent to the renamed Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center subway station on the 2 3 4 5 B Q D N R W routes, as well as directly above the LIRR's Atlantic Terminal.The arena is currently home to the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association and the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League The arena also hosts concerts, conventions and other sporting and entertainment events. It competes with other facilities in the New York metropolitan area, including Madison Square Garden in Manhattan and Prudential Center in Newark.I was there at a Barbra Streisand concert in May 2017, I loved the concert, the arena the transport to and from. Wow, I’d like to give 6 stars."
4,"We were here for the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, they had a lot of doors open &amp; it was very quick to get inside.  I don't think they were very prepared for people actually wanting to eat though because a lot of the food wasn't ready &amp; you had to wait for it to be made for you.  There is a subway stop right out front so it's super easy to get to.  The outside is always very cool!"
5,"I have been here for concerts(Yanni), Cierque su Soleil shows and the Ringling Brothers Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. Seats though new aren't as comfy as some of the other newer venues. It is huge so expect a lot of walking, some stairs depending upon which level and section you are in, and crowds but there are some seating for wheelchairs as well.Prices for tickets can be high particularly for the more famous name concerts but you can sometimes find specials on sites like Goldstar, Living Social, Groupon among a few.It is easy to reach by public transport as it is near a number of buses, subways and the LIRR Brooklyn depot.If you are tired of going to Manhattan this is a very nice option instead of the entertainment spots there."
4,Nice place lots of fun. Just another arena.. i went at night so it was dark. The concert was dark... i mean u can sit way up and still see pretty good.
3,"I am an educator so this brings me to many functions with and without youngsters to the Barclay Center. Well There are special school group tickets, (seat fillers)STAY AWAY FROM THOSE SEATS, your head is physically  touching the roof and the NETS lost every time, the kids can not see anything and you will feel guilty. Hockey games tickets are better priced but again stay away from groups. If the families can afford higher priced tickets then its worth your time....The tour of the facility is exceptional."
4,"My family loves Barclays center, it's conveniently located, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and it's always clean! I've even been able to park on the street for events, avoiding the added cost of parking. We love the wide range of events that come to Brooklyn and are hosted at Barclay's. Hope to get back real soon!!!"
4,"The food is definitely not worth it, which is not a big deal for me because I ate outside the arena before the game. As a South Carolina fan, I was absolutely ecstatic to see my team pull off the ""upset"" over Syracuse and see all the angry fans while I was going crazy.A part of me expected this arena to have more flare (although the main entryway does), but it is solid for basketball (NOT HOCKEY!). It is centrally located, right next to a subway stop, and there is lots to do around it.I have also been to Nets games, and those will probably be more electric once the team gets better."
5,"it is a pleasure to see anyone performing at the Barclay Center. Absolutely Terrific top of the line Sound System. Not a bad seat in the house..... The people that take you to your seat are wonderful.... when I first went I was using a cane.They whisked me away to their handicap balcony which overlooked the stage.We were really close!! It is now my favorite place to see anyone: show business,sports, music...."
5,"Looking to see a basketball game where no matter where you sit within the arena your experience is AWESOME. Well say no more because the Barclays Center  is just the place. Seriously there is nothing better than hearing your the kids,friends or guests  say That was a great show or game and we saw everything . The boxes are great as well .Loved the 40/40 club too . All in all my group and I left  the BC as very satisfied customers ."
2,"This was my first trip to the Barclay Center and it fell below my expectations.  I mistakenly thought there were several ""restaurants"" inside where we could have dinner.   All we saw were concession stands.   During intermission I wanted a cup of coffee - could not be found.  Plenty of cocktail and beer stands - but no coffee.  Our seats were OK - not great for the $400 price tag.  Also, we noticed several empty seats closer to the stage.  The 2 jumbo screens provided us with a closer look at Barbra but if it weren't for them, we would not have been able to see her at all and our seats were only 1 level up from the stage."
5,I've only been here once - but the ceremony was fabulous. The sound system is INCREDIBLE. And a relatively small venue.
5,"Barclays Center is a first class facility. We have seen Brooklyn Nets NBA basketball games as well as the circus there.It is very easy to get to, with many subway lines and the railroad station right underneathInside are really good places to eat, and a number of bars too."
4,"Went to see a basketball game here and it was BRILLIANT! Amazing atmosphere and the space is really well designed, seats are actually really comfortable.The only reason I've not given it 5 stars is that you can't take in food and drinks (which I get), but the prices are outrageous!! It's $8.50 for a soda and $15 for a beer. I totally get that there is a markup but that is ridiculous!"
4,We enjoyed a great concert at Barclays! The entertainment was lovely but the seats were cramped and not enough leg room.
4,"Okay location in Brooklyn, not much else around there. Good sound for concerts. Almost as big as MSG"
3,"But, there is no leg room in between the seats which makes it not as great of a venue as you want it to be."
4,Went to the Barclays arena to catch a Nets basketball game. What a great arena. All staff were really helpful. Facilities were nice and clean. Venue for watching the game was excellent. Seats were really comfortable with a good view from them. Atmosphere was better the Madison square garden for the game. Accessible by the metro which stops out front. Catch a game there if you are a sports fan. Would be great for concerts as well.
5,"Excellent, not a bad seat in the house! The price was $49 and below. We stayed only 6 minutes walking distance. Safe walk. The neighborhood is very clean and the Fulton mall."
5,Katt and the gang out did themselves. They had some serious talent on that stage. I had to use the bathroom really badly but I refused to go. I did not want to miss any of the comics performing. These guys came locked and loaded with jokes. It was an even better experience because we were given complimentary seats that were closer to the stage. My girlfriend and I originally had some nosebleed seats. lol. There was some mix up with the seating but that was sorted out in time for us to enjoy the show. Really loved this trip out. My sister did my girl and I right with these tickets. Definitely a good birthday present.
4,Easy to arrive with subway (Atlantic terminal). Close by shopping for examble Marshall's and Victoria's secret. On the arena food and drinks are expensive. On the last Islanders regular season game clothing shops prices were - 70%. The team did not make to playoffs.
4,"This relatively new facility in the heart of Downtown Brooklyn, has brought a world class venue for sports (Brooklyn Nets and NY Islanders, while they last) to the borough, and an excellent alternative (to the awful Madison Square Garden) for all New Yorkers. It looks like a strange warped spaceship, but the interior  is spacious (maybe too big?) and new, with some very pleasant amenities, to help enrich your event.  Site lines are very good, and sound is excellent.   When, and IF, the Brooklyn Nets basketball team ever gets good, this will be a great place for basketball.....  Saw an excellent Arcade Fire concert here - the sound was good (as good as a giant arena venue can be) and we came down from our seats to dance on the floor (Thank You Arcade Fire).Located immediately adjacent to the Subway, and to the LIRR station, for great access - Parking is NOT easy in the surrounding area."
4,"Went for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony. The event itself was great. Line moved pretty fast going thru security getting into arena. Seats were pretty good. Some said higher seats were pretty steep. Ushers/security could've done a better job keeping people quiet/under control during speeches throughout the night, especially by the standing room only area with tables (near section 214). Arena sits right in the middle of the neighborhood, close to some bars/restaurants, subway stop right outside."
5,"Myself my son niece and friend along with her daughter attended the game last night vs the Orlando Magic. This night was organized by my son's school. My son was selected to be apart of the high 5 line. The entire experience was wonderful. I would like especially recognize Kelly in guest services for tracking down my son's sweater that was misplaced all while having the biggest warmest smile on her face. Every single staff member was pleasant. Thank you! We are regulars here (Disney on ice, circus, Toruk,etc) and will continue to be"
3,I'll be honest with you I have no issues with the entry and how quickly we got in lots and lots of places to buy beer and food. Staff was helpful however upon the end of the concert they made everyone exit 1 door which did not seem safe at all. The staff was more concerned about the VIP Access than anything else
3,"We went to a hockey game here as it was cheaper than going to Boston! The trip in was great the only thing is there are not many chain restaurants in the area. The view from our seats was ok but there were many obstructions, seemingly no matter where you sat for the hockey game. Also, it was extremely cold in there; you could tell the regulars because they had blankets. Overall the people were pleasant considering we were rooting for the opposing team."
2,"Venue itself is nicely designed. The staff we interacted with from entrance to seats, bar, and exit were neither helpful nor friendly- and at times rude. Whatever. I don't come here for them, I just have to endure it!"
4,"It was a wonderful night out seeing Bastille in concert.  My first time there and I was pleasantly surprised. Knowing the arena was huge I came prepared with my earplugs as I'd researched the noise level in advance of going. I will say it was rather loud,decide your own comfort level.We had pretty good seats in lower level with it's own separate entrance I wouldn't want to be any higher than that..Security check wasn't a hassle,it all went quite smoothly. As I waited for the show to begin I bought popcorn and water.I enjoyed the popcorn although I thought it a bit odd that the vendor person gave me my water with the cap off. At any rate I was impressed with the center. It was clean,the band merch was easy to buy and I didn't get that trampled feeling on our exit after the concert. All in all, a very nice experience."
5,"Love, love, love. I took my daughter's to the circus. It's a great attraction. So happy the Barclay's center is in Brooklyn! super convenient to all subways."
4,Overall a nice clean arena. Not a great set up for hockey - with more impeded view locations than other arenas but if you get a good seat you need not worry. Nice fan base and nice area around the arena. End of season sale was great! For any Islanders fans.
5,Attended Barclay's for rock and roll hall of fame induction ceremony.  Everything was terrific - easy to get in and nice place.  The only thing that was a bit crazy were the $13 beers!
5,"Recently attended the Rock and Roll HOF ceremony.  First time to Barkclays.  Place is very modern, well decorated, service is good.  Seating and acoustics were perfect.  All in all a great place to see an event that is very convenient to get to."
4,"This is a nice venue. Very easy to access via the subway. Enjoyed a Brooklyn Nets game with my sons - ages 7 and 4 years old. Food pricing is expensive, as you would expect. Small bag of popcorn for $6! Highly recommend as an alternative to MSG if you are interested in bringing young kids to a professional sports outing - ticket prices are very reasonable and views from the ""cheap seats"" are still pretty good."
5,"I definetely loved to go there to watch the Brooklyn Nets win over the Detroit Pistons. I was on the second floor in the 12th row, the view was good but quite high. Anyways we really enjoyed it as we bought cheap tickets.The hotdog is very delicious, we bought it at the half time and we enjoyed it. The place is ver nice and neat."
5,"Perfect place to see a game! The structure is amazing, with a lot of options of entertainment, food and drinks. Here you can see a basketball game (Brooklyn Nets) or hockey game (New York Islanders). The subway is very close."
3,"AS an out-of-towner I can't speak to the location or convenience of The Barclays Center but having been in several large sports arenas in several other states I can say this areas has the worst pedestrian traffic flow - we had a bag but were not members of 2 or 3 different ""special"" groups which required us to pass 5 different entrances before being allow to enter a tiny side door. Most entrances were single doors, likewise the hallways inside provided only narrow passageways into the seating areas - we were truly wondering what would happen in an emergency - you're talking major bottlenecks!! There was poor lighting making the whole interior oddly dark. The lighting during the basketball game was also strange - they had bright lighting on the court itself but the stands were actually kept quite dark! The food was good quality stadium food. And we only saw one ""booth"" where fans could select from a small number of fan merchandise... NOT the major NBA experience you would expect!! We were also surprised at the relatively few fans who even wore Brooklyn Nets colors!!"
5,When people go to New York they don't always know that Brooklyn &amp; the Barclays center is a short train journey away.Prices for the Brooklyn Nets &amp; New York Islanders are way cheaper than the NY Knicks &amp; Rangers so have a look to see if there is a good on when your in town!The arena is still new &amp; looks fantastic inside and out.They have a subway station right outside too so its very accessible &amp; like most sports arenas in the US inside is loaded with a great selection of food and beverage options.
4,Nice arena for shows. Near it is where they do a flea market. This are has many options for food and shops. The mall is there but it gets crowded. Lots of traffic.
4,"We went here to see the Brooklyn Nets Vs Phoenix Suns. You cannot enter until 630pm which is fine but we got there early and so started to queue outside the box office/will call doors. There was no queuing system, no railings or anything for people to form an orderly queue. There was a very large group of teenagers being very rowdy and aggressive to each other at times and totally causing problems for the other people like myself queuing. There definitely should of been a police officer or a Barclays official to manage situations his as i was very intimidating and at one point my husband had to move me to the other side of him as he thought there was going to be a fight break out at one point and didn't want me caught in the middle of it. Once inside we go our tickets quickly and was directed efficiently to our seats. The game started on time and the officials in the arena were helpful to. Bar service was quick and the lady that served us was lovely however everything for food and drink was very expensive in there but i guess that's to be expected. Would of gave 5 stars if it wasn't for the awful queue situation"
5,"I'm a huge boxing fan who lives in PA so not too far of a drive. we check in at a close hotel and cab it from there. (I wouldn't recommend driving and trying to find a spot) they open doors about 6;30 (and I still wouldn't chance driving unless you pay for parking in advance especially if you're bad with time management like myself, learned my lesson at the Thurman and Garcia fight )I'm not a drinker but my fiancé is, so the bar is our first stop. we usually get close to the floor as possible if not floor seats .So for the ladies I recommend comfortable heels and hit the bathroom before being seated. going up and down the steps isn't too bad in heels but the floor to and from the bathroom can be a little suspect, so good grips on the bottom of your shoes help. and if you like sparkly things , go for it , it looks amazing in the lights (guys too)! Anyways great place to watch the fights, I prefer it over MSG. I've been here several times and no knuckle head stuff, always enjoyed myself and the energy from the crowd. I highly recommend it to any boxing fans,even if you want to bring children!"
5,"Venue was easily accessible from Times Square 7th avenue station. We caught the express 2 train to Atlantic avenue, which brought us right in front of the Barclay's Center. The staff was great and efficient, helped us to our seats. We had a blast, food was expensive but good. I ordered Dewerys on the rocks which was 10$. 2 hot dogs for 11$. Bathrooms were clean, venue was nice. Hats off to the  seating supervisor for section 118, she was professional."
5,"02024-1016 was my first time visiting the Barclays Center.  located near subway station  High quality venue .. great viewing from every seat, friendly event staff, right near train station.  Easy to get in and out of.  World class facility - love going there !"
5,The Barclays Center is easy to get to with a subway stop right outside. I found the facilities to be modern and entry and exit from arena were both pretty painless experiences.
3,Average steel-structured arena with good subway access in Brooklyn. It's fine but just doesn't compare with beautiful MSG.
4,We went here to see an Islanders game.  We were in the upper levels but still a great view thanks to stadium seating and big screens.  Another plus is that it's new and still pretty clean.  The food was just awful though.  We went to Paisano's which strangely has no Italian food.  We ordered chicken fingers with fries and a hamburger and soda.  29 dollars.  They made my sons burger wrong but we only found this out after we sat down again.  And for 10 or 12 dollars you get 3 chicken fingers and about 10 fries.  I asked the guy working there if this is all we get and he said yes.  It was a joke.  Burger was the size of a mcdonalds hamburger and that was 10 dollars. Eat before you go in or afterwards because it's seriously that bad and that skimpy.  We took the train which goes right to the Atlantic terminal and then you just cross the street to the stadium  Not in the best area so we left right after the game.
4,But is the the prices reasonable??? One beer and 2gintonics cost 44dollar.Good service and experince to see NHL game but expensive.
3,"I visited the venue twice for a hockey game and twice for a concert. The venue is not set up for hockey games, so have to know where to sit so you have a good view. Nassau Coliseum was way better for a hockey game. Sat on the sides for the concerts. The venue was just OK. The music is deafening on the side in the close rows.  Sat in section 210 the second time, music quality was better but Islander's Stanley cup banners were distracting. Just way too inconvenient to use mass transit to get to the venue from NJ, so stuck driving. Never would have found the parking garage without GPS. Portion of Pacific Ave was closed so made finding the lot more difficult."
4,"I visited the BC for a NBA match between the Nets and the Dallas Mavs. The arena is just outstanding and impressive. However, the atmosphere wasn't really good. People just follow the match without showing strong emotions.It's crazy that you can buy tickets at the box office only 60 min before the game get started. However, prices are reasonable. You can join an NBA game for just 30 Dollars and have a pretty good view."
1,When the announcer is pleading with the audience to cheer on the Nets you know it's a dead crowd. I've been churches that are more boisterous than this. Also how about open up the upper concourse concessions so that the average wait time for say a soda isn't 35 minutes. Ridiculous.
5,"Barclays is a great facility. Just an odd configuration that it's not your typical lower level bowl. Concessions were plentiful and our usher in section (6-7) was amazing. I wish I knew her name to recognize her but it was the Saturday, 3/18/17 game versus Columbus Blue Jackets. She was awesome and beyond hospitable. Thanks to her for making the out of town guests from Ohio feel welcomed. Our family had a great time that day."
5,"We went to watch the Brooklyn Nets play having never been to a live basketball game before and thinking it was a key sporting event when in the US. Although the atmosphere can be quite forced at times (they whip the crowd up with cheerleaders, free t shirts and singalong chants) it's also a lot of fun and makes the event enjoyable for everyone - even those who don't like sport! Food is good, there's loads of options but it is crazy expensive so be warned!"
4,"Took the subway from Manhattan with my daughter (very easy &amp; safe) to catch an Islanders game.  The subway stop is right at the entrance, so very convenient.  It's a different hockey arena than the others I've been in, the ice surface is more to one end, and seating is really only on 3 sides.  We had a great view from the upper level for a cheap price (compared to tickets in Canada.)  The fans up there were very intense, and entertaining.  We had a good time!"
5,"Green Day was at Barclays last night and we trekked over there from Essex County, NJ the day after a blizzard.  I wasn't so excited about it.  I was so excited when we arrived at the entrance - and what an entrance it is.  The sculptures and nicely designed modern entrance gets you really excited.  Getting in was very organized and quick between the ticket takers and security.  The seats were great - nice and big.  There were great food options all over the place and plenty of bathrooms.  It just looks very modern, which I loved.  It added to the excitement."
3,"impressive building from the outside....excellent for basketball, hockey not so much, too many obstruction seats.....friendly staff and security...."
5,Sat upper level - sideline for the ACC Tournament and was pleased with the view.  The arena was very easy to find (subway station in the plaza of the arena).  It was also easy to navigate.  It is quite an eyesore from the outside though.  Not sure what the bird's nest theme was meant to represent.
5,"Hockey is played here and other events are held here, but this was built primarily for basketball and it is a terrific hoops arena. Sight lines are great, amenities are great (beautiful scoreboard), very clean, very shiny and new. I mean, it's not the Mecca -- Madison Square Garden -- but we were down for the 2017 ACC tourney and it is a good place to watch a basketball game. Decent concession prices as well."
5,I came here to see UFC 208 and enjoyed the experience.  The staff were helpful and probably not in getting a high volume of people through security and to their seats.  I enjoyed a nice beer and hotdog and saw several other nice vending options.  The view of the octagon from my seat was perfect.  It appears most seats offered a good view.
5,Great venue Good seating and viewsFast entry and exit Easily to get to bathrooms and food/beer options
4,"Great arena, beautiful sightlines all around.  A couple of the sections in the upper corners looked a little strange but whatever, I wouldn't sit there.  The food options were really good but a bit pricey.  Definitely a great place to catch a game!"
4,"Just saw a few days of basketball here for the first time,  wow what a venue.  Outside looks like a museum or space ship,  inside is very spacious and clean.  Easy to find seats and comfortable.  The drinks were outrageously priced.  $1.00 a  ounce is too much for a beer,  especially since i heard they are almost half as much at islanders games!"
4,Went to watch ACC basketball tournament. Great location with access to several subway lines from Manhattan and an LIRR stop. Food choices a little limited.
3,So this is the 2nd time I have been to this venue first was basketball now a concert not bad place for a show I would definitely have a seat in the lower bowl the upper deck is bad depending where you are I was in section 222 row 5 not a bad view but any higher it's nose bleeds overall clean bathrooms nice venue and if you want to eat buy food outside the venue before you come in 6.00 bucks for a water and 5 dollars for a pretzel the prices do go higher. So your best bet is to eat outside the venue.
5,Easy to get to on subway. Took taxi after. Never been there before but it was easy. Kids enjoyed circus.
4,Had a good time at the game tonight. Wasn't impressed with the crazy expensive food prices though. Also the arena has limited viewing seats which aren't the greatest. Good time all around.
4,"We wanted to see a sports event and chose the Nets even though none of our family really care about basketball.  But seeing a sports event is a good way to get off the tourist routes and see more of what locals experience.The venue itself was clean and well ordered - puts many UK venues to shame, for what is probably a fairly run-of-the-mill venue by US standards.  Food and drink are RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE - that's why I gave it 4 stars - so better to eat before you go.  I got a couple of souvenir Nets shirts for my children for $10 each so that wasn't bad but they were on special so imagine that other merchandise is pricey.It was just really good to see how Americans ""do"" sports - lots of razzmatazz, flag waving, national anthems and 2 local kids teams playing at half time.I got the tickets through a company called Ticket Liquidator before I went - face value $75 but I got them for $40 (before fees).  I think that Americans are more used to secondary market/resale sites for tickets than we are in the UK so I was initially worried that I might have been scammed (when I bought them before I left) but it was all OK when I turned up with our tickets.Easy to get to via Subway from Manhattan.Good trip, clean venue, very American, very expensive food and drink but a great (people-watching) experience.  The Nets lost, however (but I get the impression that that's not unusual!)"
3,"My family went there for a Nets game last month. If you can look beyond the Nets losing every single game, it is easy to enjoy Barclay. As Brooklynites, it is simply hard to watch your home team keep losing game after game. If you are a tourist, you probably can enjoy the place more than we do."
5,"Travelled from Canada to go to the game.  Long story short we support junior hockey and some of our home team boys now play for the Islanders.  Building was clean, staff helpful and food was good Wine was pretty great too lol  Bathrooms were tidy"
4,This comment will not be useful for very long as the circus will soon be leaving and not coming back.  I had searched several sites looking for comments on the best place to sit.  We sat in section 23 row 18.  Most of the action was directly in front of us.  Row 18 was fine.  We did not have to walk too far down with the kids. Bathrooms and  concession stands were at close.    A better choice may have been section 16 which is at the head of the action.  Sections 7 and 25 are too far away from  most of the main action.  I bought a seat for the three year old.  That was a waste of money.  He sat in a lap the entire show.  Most people with small children did not have tickets for them.  A note on concession stands.  They dont all sell the same food.  So you may want to walk around  before deciding.  Take your strollers.  There are places to check it close to the seating area
4,"We went to a Nets game (against Trailblazers) on a Saturday afternoon and they got whooped big time.  The score at halftime was like 75 to 65 and ended up like 141 to 119.  yikes.  I really like the coziness of the arena. When we went out for food and drinks, there were enough room to walk around even though the arena was fairly full.  There were nice tall tables to eat or drink at and the bar was not crowded so easy to order drinks.  The entire area is changing and actually fun to explore."
1,"I've been trying to find out about tickets for a particular event.  Having contacted Ticketmaster and they didn't respond, I thought I'd go directly to the venue.  So uch for the all-singing, all-dancing customer service the Americans ar so proud of.  They haven't had the decency to rsay spend either!  Not impressed at all!"
3,"The outside of the building looks like a rusted crushed hat. Inside, it is not built for Hockey as the sight lines in each corner are obstructed. Paid over 300$ for two tickets and had to stand to partially see the play in the corner. Definitely not going back for another game. Also, they could turn down the volume."
5,"On reflection the Ice Hockey game was the best experience of our New York holiday, I would highly recommend everyone to watch a game, the way things are set up it is also a very family orientated event.The Islanders new home at the Barclay Centre Brooklyn is very close to the subway 50m from entrance to entrance. A modern new multi-event centre but the home of the Islanders Ice Hockey team.My son and saw the Islanders vs Colerado game, which we enjoyed so much we returned a few days later to see the Islanders vs Rangers game. We were Islanders fans after the first match so it was a good job they won both matches. The game is so fast and exciting it gets the adrenalin going, from start to finish.Tickets are not cheap, but if you can buy from the box office as ticket agents are double. Drinks and hot dogs/chips (fries) are expensive as in most sporting events $12 for a can of beer."
5,"We visited the Barclays Centre twice during our visit to New York. We saw the Islanders play hockey and the Nets host a basketball match. Tickets were very reasonable for both sports and even from the cheaper upper seats the view was great.The Barclays Centre itself is a nice modern sporting venue, the staff are friendly and it is very easy to get to using the subway (only about 25 mins or so from midtown). Definitely worth a visit."
3,Honestly there's food is pretty expensive but you are stuck you don't have a choice can't really bring in anything so you get what you can get.
4,"Take advantage of yet another awful season by the Brooklyn Nets and get your hands in some cheap tickets. Nice arena and friendly staff. Food is overpriced, as expected. But hey, it is still NBA!"
5,I love going here. Its so clean and the arena in huge.its right near all the trains so its fast to get there. They have a variety of foods
4,"Nice, new arena. Good amenities. Our seats, although with the end of the quarter, had an excellent view of the game."
5,"Friends and myself had enjoyed our time together while cheering for our team. I love this huge stadium with it's easy access to commuters on trains, cabs, restaurants, etc."
4,Nice arena from inside and outside. It's very easy to get there by subway.Helpful staff.Watching a NBA game is such a nice programm. The tickets are cheaper than that offered to Madison Square.
5,"The sight lines were amazing and every seat was a great seat in the house. I got a seat 14 rows from the court for $25.00 and saw an amazing game.  The arena was half full, but the energy was so high you didn't noticed it.  I look forward to returning to seeing another game as soon as possible.  The only bad thing was they took my lid from my water bottle, but my friend the person behind me in line did not have to have his lid removed. This was the only frustrating experienced during my visit."
5,Our electronic ticket failed due to internet connection - thank goodness for Starbucks!! We were able to download it on their wifi!!Anyway - venue is fun - it's like Wembley or the O2. Easy to get to and helpful staff
5,We went here to watch a NY Islanders game and had a great time and the experience was just as good as watching the NY Rangers at the Garden. Don't be put off by the journey as it takes just 30-35 mins from Time Square on the subway (Red 2/3 line) and has no stops and drops you right at the centre. Not that many places to eat inside so I would recommend eating before you go in to see the game. We didn't pay for really expensive seats $45 and still had a really great view opposite the goal line so you don't need premium seats.
4,"Had a great time at the Barclays Center for the RnB Ladies Night Concert. My fiance got us good tickets. We enjoyed the acts that performed and the surprise guest, 112, that substituted for Keith Sweat who was sick. They were actually a better choice. My only complain was the quality of the mics or sound system."
5,"Nice venue, well run, comfortable. Small lines at the concessions, friendly and helpful staff. It was easy in and out. Close to the subway station."
4,"Know what was there before, a railway yard for the LIR, to now being a premiere arena, it's a great engineering feet. It's lay out is traditional with a variety of amenities to buy food and gifts. I saw Disney On Ice with the family and was at first surprised at how small it seemed inside.  Then as I focused on the show, I remembered the space they had to build it in and was then appreciative of their use of space to create the illusion.I'm sure it's not perfect for every event but I'm glad Brooklyn has it's own and we don't have to always go to the Garden or out to Long Island for arena events."
1,"I've been to the Barclays Center for a basketball game and it was ok, but I cannot say the same about being there for a hockey game. The seating layout is NOT conducive to hockey AT ALL, and having so many blocked off seats (in addition to many, MANY empty seats) totally kills the vibe. They also excessively pump in crowd noise to make it sound as though there are people there (the speaker was directly in front of us). Also, the upper level seating is DANGEROUS because they have cup holders ON THE FLOOR of the incredibly narrow aisles. I almost tripped and fell, and later on I saw someone do just that, nearly breaking their ankle in the process. Of course, this could certainly happen at any event there, not just hockey."
4,Depending on where you sit and price you paid will determine your experience. Food and beverage is priced same as almost all NYC stadiums. Any seat in the upper part of the upper bowl will feel steep. Besides that I been there for a concert and a few basketball games and most views are great.
5,Security check was friendly and fast. No line to wait in. Friendly staff all over the stadium. Good atmosphere.
4,"The arena is beautiful! I don't think I have seen the entire building to date. View is good from all seats and boxes. Employees and vendors are friendly and helpful. Vendors are from major food chains, like Nathans and Juniors CheeseCake. Restrooms are clean and family friendly. It is conveniently located above most subway stations, busstops and the Long Island Railroad. The one drawback, like many places in a recession; it is pricey to bring a family."
4,It's a lot more pleasant and doesn't smell like the garden.More comfortable and easier to get in and out.They do have a better food and drinks selection but it still costs an arm and a leg.
3,"While this is a very convenient venue for local Long Islanders and city dwellers, the seats are super small and there is almost no space between rows. I'm 4'11"" and even when I stand up to let someone by we end up touching. Also very steep inclines. Ladies, do not bring anything larger than a crossbody!Otherwise, they put up nice big screens for those in the higher sections."
5,Went for UFC208 with my son. Easy to get to and from (all night Q train back to Manhattan) on public transport. Security checks quick and easy. Lines at concession stands are short. Prices there are about average for event venues. Food and drink was varied and decent. All staff we encountered were helpful and friendly. Seats seem to have good views for all but are a little tight on the legs with not much room for manoeuvre. Sound system was just mind blowing! Awesome. All in: a great night out.
5,"First visit for sold-out Nets Knicks game.  Easy access, great seats, super sound system and variety of refreshments.  Now if the teams would conform to that high standard."
5,Our first time attending a concert (Eric Church) at Barclays Center.  We will definitely return.   The staff handled entry and exit with efficiency with attention to safety.   Staff members were friendly and welcoming.     We had mid-level seats...perfect!      We stayed at EVEN Hotel---walking distance with ease.
5,So impressed to get cheap seats and so close to ice !!! Great game since the islanders won 4-2 !!! Would love to go to another game one day
5,"There is not a bad seat in the house.  We have seen 3 concerts and the value is increased because of the venue. The neighborhood is well-lit, some very desirable shopping and restaurants close by. Plenty of dining options inside, too. As in most entertainment places, beverages are pricey. It's is easy to get to, subways very close by, and parking garages are plentiful. Highly recommend seeing your favorite artists at Barclays."
3,Here for a concert with 2 other couples. Venue is nice but not worth the prices they were charging for drinks. 2 vodkas with soda: $48 !We ate elsewhere but it's unreasonable that venues think they can do that to people. No wonder it was 3/4 full.
5,Nice seats with cup holders over priced food and drink as seems to be at any place I have been fans were friendly even tho I was going for the opposing team
4,"My partner and I attended an ice hokey game in the Barclays Center whilst visiting NYC from the UK. It was pretty cold in there and we were sat up in the gods as well. It was a really fun experience and the place itself is really impressive! The prices for food and drinks however, is not! They search your bags when you go into the center so it's not like you can take your own bottle of water in or something..but I suppose it's like any sort of arena really, the prices are always expensive"
4,"We attended a Brooklyn Nets game here (I won't mention the final score) and found the  arena to be ideal, with a great choice of food and beverages, and I'd imagine there's not a bad seat in the house.Food isn't too pricey considering it's a sport &amp; concert venue, although drinks were pretty expensive, but that's to be expected.The only negative would be the lack of signposting for regular ticket holders, there's plenty of entrances for VIP / Premium / Club tickets, but very difficult to navigate to the 'Regular People' entrance. We also could only find one door, with one metal detector / security point, meaning a severe bottleneck to get inside. We only just got to our seats in time for tip-off.All in all a great venue, with good facilities, clean toilets, but some work needed to shepherd the masses inside."
4,My first tie to the Barclays.  the place itself is very nice and we had good seats -- down on the side.  The bathrooms were relatively new so they were clean and looked good.
5,"I took in an Islanders game last month and really enjoyed the atmosphere even as a Bruins fan. The food and alcohol prices were high but that's to be expected in NY. Avoid sitting in sections 201-204 and 228-221 as well as sections directly below due to the limited view of the ice, you wont be able to see the net on that end."
3,"Attended Flyers/Islanders hockey game.  Nice stadium, but beware of seat selection.  Do your homework, there are tons of obstructed/limited view seats"
5,Our party of 3 really enjoyed going to watch a Nets game. The venue is clean and has a very friendly helpful staff. Everyone from the door greeters to people working concessions was top notch. Our tix included food package which is the way to go. Prices for food are high just like every other venue across the country in every sport. The place was also clean and will be back again for another game or event.
4,Really good game of ice hockey. Good view. But why so expensive? Is it me paying all the teams wages?
5,"Having attend a Brooklyn Nets fixture in January 2016, it was time to return again this January. The arena is brilliant, hi tech, spacious and good fun. Plenty of different food outlets around the concourse and lots of things to do before, during and after the game. We attended with my three year old daughter who had a great time despite the Nets coming out losing to the Jazz."
4,"While down on Long Island for business I decided to catch the rail and take in an Islanders game. Getting to the stadium was pretty easy and the Barclays Center was a nice venue. I always wondered why it looked so dark on TV and now I know.... the whole inside is black. Good game, I'd go again."
5,Busy area with lots of traffic. Best for walking. Parking is not guaranteed on the streets. Lots to do. Short walk from many hotels. There is lots of food and shopping near.
2,"My last visit was the worst, I've ordered the same seats the last four games, and this time, my seats weren't set up for food until I cleared it up, that it does include food, my assigned server never waited on me for drinks, I used a server from another section, who was very accommodating, why me, your personal server is included in the section that I have tickets for. I told a friend never again, but we will see, I've had only two servers this season, so that makes the Barclays experience very personable, except this time around my assigned server was MIA, but thanks again for a server (Tyeisha), from another section, stepping up and taking care of me...."
4,"Watched an NBA and an NHL game.  Both were good but enjoyed the fan base for the NY Islanders a bit more.  Overall, super easy to get to from Manhattan and depending on which line you are coming from, the metro stop is either 30 seconds or 3 minutes away.  As well, really good pricing on tickets and overall the facility is clean and roomy."
5,"Came here on a trip to see an ice hockey game. Non of the family had been to one before, or any American sports really, but it was a great idea and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. The Barclays centre is very easy to navigate and find your seats and there is no bottle-necking in areas when people arrive / leave as in some other stadiums. We had seats which were quite high up and near the back, but it didn't matter because the steep angle of the seating areas meant we had a great vantage point to see everything very clearly. The atmosphere was incredible and I would definitely go again!"
5,No hassle. Great experience getting in &amp; out. Right across the street from Atlantic Terminal &amp; subway station.
4,"We've been there to compare NHL with the known experience from Switzerland.Absolute great show, but the show becomes more important than the game itself. Overall absolutely worth a visit for a hockey game."
4,"This is a must see if you are in town, Brooklyn Nets play here and staff is very professional and very helpful!"
5,This was such a nice place! Our suite was amazing! Lots of options for beer and food. The staff was very helpful and friendly!
5,We went to an NBL game and we're sitting up with the gods. We weren't expecting to see much but the view was great and we could see everything on the court. The seating is really steep but that was why the view was so good from the top. Fantastic atmosphere and a lot cheaper than heading in to central NY.
4,We were in NYC from 26 Dec for almost a week and originally looked at watching ice hockey at MSG - but tickets were really expensive. We had a look at the Barclays Center and ended up going to see 1) Brooklyn Nets NBA game on 26 Dec and 2) NY Islanders NHL game on 27 Dec - tickets to both for 2 of us came to c.£220 total which we thought was pretty reasonable (particularly compared to MSG!). The venue was great - easy to get to on the subway and a load of bars / food places nearby. Word of warning - drinks inside are extortionate! We went to a couple of bars on 5th avenue (down the road) before the events where beer was around $5 (even $2.80 on happy hour 4-6ish in some places!) rather than $11.50 for a can inside the center.  You always expect high drinks prices inside venues like this but it seemed pretty ridiculous - we just didn't get drinks inside but plenty of people did! Worth a visit for any sports fan - great experience in a very modern venue :-)
5,The Barclay center is a amazing there are no bad seats in the whole arena. We has a blast and the seat were surprising comfortable.
5,The Barclay Center is awesome.   Great venue for sporting events!  The seating at the venue is excellent and the staff is informative and friendly.
4,We went to see a great Ice Hockey game whilst on a short break to NYC. The price here compared to Maddison Square Gardens was hugely more reasonable and made it accessible for tourist like us who had a busy and packed itinerary. Short journey on subway from Penn Station to Brooklyn was fairly easy to navigate and a good opportunity to get out of Manhatten and see a bit more of this huge city. Brooklyn great with lots of food choices and great bars too.
5,"We went there to see the Nets. It was our first NBA match and this is a perfect place. A brand new arena with nice facilities and above all, it is quite cheap if we compare it with the Madison. Recommendable."
5,"We got tickets a few days earlier for the Capitals and Islanders hockey game. Nice arena, decent food and ample bathrooms.  Too bad Caps lost............good game though!"
4,Basketball ain't my sport but was entertaining and we had a last second win.  Venue is modern and offers food and drink of a decent standard.  If you book upper seating be aware it's pretty steep but great views go nets.  Not much that we could see around the venue
4,"Every time I go back to the city I check the shows. This time, as the tickets to see the knicks were sold out ... I decided to see the Nets.The experience was incredible ... the stadium is 5 stars: nothing to envy the MSG ... super easy to access and in the area of restaurantes. The acoustics are great and the attractions very well synchronized; the annual schedule is very interesting: do not stop studying it as an alternative off the island."
5,"From someone who works in a premier league football stadium, this place is outstanding. Queues initially seemed confusing but once in, the facilities are great. Lots of places to get drinks and food at reasonable enough prices and the toilets are all very clean. Cheaper seats still have a pretty good view and the t-shirt guns have no issues reaching them. Great atmosphere and an enjoyable game. Travelling back to our hotel in Manhattan was easy on the subway and only $6 for two of us."
4,"At Barclays Center for the first time.  Very nice.  Similar to the new stadiums/arenas with nicer food venues and more stylish internal design than older stadiums (I'm old).  But when you're in your seats, it's still a stadium, and oddly on one side of the arena you can't see the hockey goal.  We knew that, but it's still a bit nuts to design an arena so that everyone in one area (everyone on the back wall behind the goal) can't see the goal.  And, it's just insane to charge $6.50 for a 10 oz soda even if that's the going stadium price.  At least, for $6.50, make it 20 oz as the soda costs about $0.05.  Other food prices are high, but don't seem quite as ridiculous.  Four sodas cost more than half the price of a ticket."
4,"Thought we would try a basketball game whilst on holiday in NY. Loved every minute of the experience.Barclays centre is easy to reach by subway, the stop is right in front of the venue. Loads of food places inside, although food and drink is really expensive. Seats good, atmosphere great. Great commentary throughout the game so even as a rookie, you don't feel lost. Some of the staff could have been friendlier but doesn't ruin the experience. Nets won!"
3,"Scored a couple last minute, seats to check out the Islanders. The arena is very cold, so make sure you bring a few extra layers. Food options inside are impressive, but pricey.  If you want to watch a hockey game in NY, I prefer MSG. Barclays arena is better suited for live concerts then sports."
3,I went here for a hockey game and it was ok but nothing like the NVMC. I liked the seats but the atmosphere was not there. it was good because it was new but there are problems with the ice and more. might be good for concert but not hockey.
5,"As a tourist from London on holiday, we took in an Ice Hockey game here. A terrific venue and atmosphere to be enjoyed. Fantastic value for money ticket wise, although the price of food and drink is very pricey inside, around 13 dollars a pint of beer. This is probably to be expected but you can't take anything in with you, as you go through airport style security when you enter. A fantastic experience for any sports fan, especially if you are visiting the states and want to see some live sport. It is also a much cheaper option that going to Maddison square gardens."
5,"Both my wife and me are not Nets or Warriors fans. We figured to catch a NBA game while we were in town and this was the best match-up. Barclays Center is a great place to catch a game. It was our first experience at an American sports arena and we were glad it was here. As one of the newer stadiums, the amenities were modern and it was a thoroughly comfortable experience. We had seats in the first row of the top bowl which gave us a pretty good overall view of the court - even managing to score one of the little parachutes which they dropped from the ceiling! Tickets were pricey though - $300 each for this game as compared to approx. $150 for similar seats for a Hornets game a few days later on. The subway is easily accessible from Barclays Center and there is even a Shake Shack across the street! It does get quite crowded so go early if you want to get your Shake Shack in before the game. I appreciated the bags policy, i.e. anything smaller than a mid-sized backpack is generally allowed. This was much welcome as compared to that at Gillette Stadium which understandably is a lot harder to manage given the number of people involved.I would really recommend catching a game at the Barclays Center if you happen to be in NYC! We were lucky the Nets caught fire in the first half - Jeremy Lin and Brook Lopez had big games, while the Warriors woke up after a near-certain lashing from Steve Kerr during half time."
5,"We saw Jimmy Buffett, James Taylor, and Sarah McLachlan here on 12-9-16. I've seen Jimmy Buffett in at least 10 different venues and this one was, by far, the absolute best sound quality of any venue I've visited.  The staff and security personnel were friendly and helpful.  Seating was comfortable and easy to get to.  Getting into and out of the venue was pretty seamless.  Great visit.  I'll be back."
3,We went to Barclays for the Holiday Concert ..... the venue itself was nice enough but the organization was sorely lacking trying to get in.  We missed 20 minutes of the concert while waiting in line to have our purses looked at and walk through the metal detector.  I'm not saying these measures were excessive but notification that there could be delays DUE to these measures would be nice.
3,"Went to the Rangers / Isles game Tuesday night. The ice is not centered under the jumbotron. The banners are given no respect (hockey or basketball); they are partially hidden behind lights. The sound is ok. We had seats in section 217, row 3 so we were pretty much centered behind the goal.The Islander fans were not great. They only got excited when the Isles scored and were fairly quiet outside of that. There were more Rangers fans than Islanders. The concourse were nice and wide. The bathroom situation had to be pretty bad when men were having to wait in line to use them. The prices were about average for an arena.It was nice that there was a metro station across the street from the arena."
5,Beautiful new arena with the friendliest staff very clean with lots of food options and comfortable chairs ...
1,Went to see James Taylor at the WCBS holiday show. James Taylor was amazing. What was not amazing  were the seats Rip off!!! They are folding chairs that were full of dust and dirt. What you are not told is that floor seats are the worst seats you can buy. The workers at the Barclay Center were so helpful and friendly. The patrons were rude!!! Will never go there again.
3,"Went to the CBS Radio Holiday Show to see James Taylor, Jimmy Buffet and Sarah McLoughlin. The performers were great,but the venue was poor. There were no house lights before and after the concert. The stage lights focused on the headliners and not tbe musicians or backup singers. Strobe and spotlights were constantly aimed out into tbe crowd making it impossible to see the stage or big screens. Been to other large venues, and never left disappointed until now. Maybe Barclays should just stick to Basketball!"
5,"Went there whilst in Manhattan to see the Nets play the Lakers. Metro straight to the front entrance, comfortable seats, quality but expensive drinks and food outlets, nice atmosphere - all round great experience."
5,Great hockey game! We got 'restricted' view seats... that's had an awesome view! Lovely place clean toilets and polite and helpful staff
5,"I recommend this to anyone. Booked a Nets game and walked across the bridge before it started to get some stunning views of the city from the Brooklyn side. The basketball did not disappoint, such a great experience."
5,"Great facility, the subway is straight to the front entrance, comfortable seats, nice atmosphere, drinks and food are expensive, but all round great experience."
5,Took my son for his 16th bday to see his fav team golden state warriors against the brooklyn nets and we had such a great time
4,The center is located near a subway station {3lines} the main entrance is for people without ticket .The people with electronic ticket they must use a secondary entry. Ther'is a a queue for security check. In the center you can't use professional camera with zoom [the maximum zoom you can use is 18-55]. To go to upper sector you must use the elevator. To go to your seat you must wait the play is stopped. Wifi is free in all area. The sound is very good and in the upper sector you can see good all games. Food is simple and expensive
4,I saw a NY Islanders game versus the NY Rangers hockey game. It's located across the street from the Atlantic Terminal Station for the New York City subway and Long Island Rail Road. Prices for food and drinks are expensive. I will return for more games and concerts.
5,Went here for the 105.1 powerhouse concert with my boyfriend and it was my first time there for a concert. It was very nice and big.
4,Enjoyed the game but the crowd was lame. As in that there was almost no crowd. Center was almost 2/3 empty. Good venue. Easy access to subway.
4,"Accessible arena with very friendly staff. Ensure that you get to the arena as early as possible as you need to be processed by security (bag check etc). There are plenty of concession stands to get something to eat or drink and vendors sell drinks in the lower tiers. It's very easy to get in and out at the end of an event and it's very close to public transport. As a tip, if you're going to watch the ice hockey wrap up warm as it's very very cold! If you're planning to get a picture with the Captain America status (Just a boy from Brooklyn) do so before the event as it's very busy afterwards."
4,Recently saw Keith urban play here. The place is nice great sound system. One thing that was strange is your required to have paper tickets. They do not scan off your phone so be prepared for that and 13.00 dollars a beer. Other than that nice place
3,"New and very modern sports center in Brooklyn. We watch there Islanders vs Lightning and everything works well, but beer &amp; food is very expensive. Free wifi is good. Bets way to go there is subway."
5,"Confidently located to parking strictures and the subway, the Barclays Center is a great arena. The seats are comfortable and there bathrooms were clean. There are numerous dining options both inside and just outside."
5,We recently attended the Brooklyn Invitational Basketball Tournament and found the facility an excellent place to watch a game.
4,"I've been here for quite a few concerts and Brooklyn Nets games. Views from most seats are decent. Drink prices are expensive and they only sell you one drink at a time, so u can't buy one for ur friend sitting back in the stands and they card you. 40/40 club is nice. Overall friendly service. Can be a walk to get a cocktail but beer is everywhere."
4,"Awesome sporting venue, first time there for a hockey game. Great food choices, as expected expensive drinks."
2,I recently attended a concert with country star Blake Shelton. The Barclay center was rock-in and Blake was incredible but what I noticed was the quality of the audio was poor at best. I don't quit understand why a brand new venue would over look the acoustics in what could be a phenomenal music concert hall but they did. I may have to travel back to the Grand Ole Opry next time I want to see Shelton.
5,"Took the family to watch the Brooklyn Nets here, great experience for all, a real spectacle and non-stop entertainment. Arena wasn't full, but great atmosphere and at around £25 each, really good value too when compared to the Knicks, Giants, Jets etc. If a game is on during your trip, well worth the effort and you can tie in a visit to Brooklyn beforehand"
5,We took in an ice hockey game on our recent visit to NY. The tickets vary tremendously in value from a few dollars up to hundreds of dollars. We paid around $30 each. We were high up but had great views. We spoke with a police officer before we went in and he said there were no bad seats/views in the venue and he was right. My tip would be don't break the bank and purchase expensive seats. The more reasonable priced ones are just as good.
5,"Barclays Center is an impressive stadium. Very clean, easy to get to and navigate once inside! We went for a hockey game, even though we were sat near the top we still had an excellent view of the ice!"
4,"Very emotional Olympians' exhibition! Perfect the fusion between strength, agility, choreography, music, lights and engagement.Very easy to get there from Manhattan. Easy to get into the venue."
5,Well received treated like   valuable customer my team (Canucks) didn't win but we had a great time anyways raucous crowd but not rowdy felt comfortable there wheelchair seating was real good great price for NHL hockey.
4,We went to see a hockey match (New York Islanders v Montreal). What a great night! We were worried about getting there and did regret not going to a match at Madison Square Garden. However the journey was very easy on the subway and it was quick to get a train back to Times Square. The stadium itself is excellent. Would certainly return there. And for more hockey. Also of note: we bought re-sold tickets on Ticketmster. No problem picking up the tickets at the venue
3,"This is a nice new arena, built for the Brooklyn Nets basketball team and concerts.  But it is the home, possibly temporarily, of the New York Islanders, the NHL team.  And the arena was not built for hockey.I had a seat in one of the corner sections, and you cannot see play in the near corner and you have only a partial view of the goal.  In talking to season ticketholders, they told me that there are many seats like that, since the ice rink was a later addition.So, if you are going to a game, get seats along the sides of the arena.  The end seats may be obstructed views (and not labeled as such on the ticket sites).The customer service staff was very helpful and did relocate me to a seat with full view.Another note: when I complained to Ticketmaster, they told me that this was a resale ticket and they do not require people who list tickets to indicate obstructions, etc."
5,Bought corner obstructed view tickets 20 rows from the ice surface for 26 dollars american.  We were worried about the obstruction but on arrival the obstruction was minor and we were so close to the ice that it didnt really matter.  Couple that with the jumbo tron and we didnt miss anything.  Best value I have ever found for a hockey game.  We wouldnt hesitate to sit in these seats again. The obstruction is due to the stadium being built for basketball and there was a slight loss of view of the corner opposite to the net.  Lean forward or stand up and this is not an issue.
4,"Barclays Center is a really nice arena. It's relatively new compared to MSG, but it's also well maintained and clean. Even ""bad"" seats have a decent view. Note that food prices are double that of airports."
5,My Family and I went to the Barclay Center for the first time. I was first impressed about the design of the Center. The workers there were wonderful and very helpfull. My Wife uses a walker. The seats were not accessible. We spoke to worker and they promptly gave us excellent area where my Wife and Daughter also uses a walker could get around. We have plans already to go back for a show...
5,"I smile when I hear that I will be attending an event at the Barclays. Since opening I have been to a boxing night, a wwe event and a concert. I figure that if they all run their events the same way, why would anyone not want to go? It was spectacular and gives way for its own expansion."
5,"Was here 3 nights in a row watching WWE events and loved it.  The arena is superb, well placed in a decent area and very accessible from NYC."
1,"I took our family to a game there.  We have gone to games all over the country and this was the worst experience by far. We bought tickets which were obstructed.  I have been at old Boston Garden and many other places with obstructed seating so my expectations were not high. But we could not see anything inside the blueline! I moved and found another non obstructed lower level seat and the sight lines were also bad.  The atmosphere was bad. Why is there a car at ice level, this is not Europe. The food was expensive and bad. The only thing good about the game was the ending. I am honestly shocked that a new facility can be so badly designed.  It is shameful  I would go to any other arena but this one if you are considering a road trip to see a game.. How did NYI and Nets let this happen??? Kudos tot the NYI for continuing to support the team in spite of it all!"
4,"This is a great venue and great location.  Everything you need is right outside the center.  It is not huge, so it is easy to get around inside.    The prices are crazy hi though.  If you can eat outside or before or after, do it.   If not mucho bucks, if you don't mind spending ...   seating is nice too!  You don't feel like a sardine."
5,"We were told by locals (my cousins) to check out this stadium rather than Madison Square Garden. It's a newer stadium and very clean. We saw an ice hockey match here, had a ball! The tickets were cheaper here for the seats we got compared to Madison Square Garden. We grabbed dinner at Franny's beforehand, good pizza and got shakes after the game at Shake Shack!"
5,What a great arena. So clean!  Plenty of food choices. Lots of friendly ushers and food staff. Comfortable seats.  We'll be back!!
4,"Home town crowd wearing Brooklyn garb, very welcoming to all. Beautiful stadium with comfortable seats and great visual in most levels. Diverse but expensive fast foods featuring the cuisines of Brooklyn, several types of pizza, Nathan's  and more. Service is slow. Alcohol available very in plastic cups!"
5,"I was given seats which were fifth row center ice and gave you access to the Calvin Klein club.  The seats were great and comfortable. Very wide. The club had a lot of food including sushi, sliders, Nathan's franks, spare ribs, Chinese food, and ice cream.  Food is plentiful and served through the first intermission.  The staff was very professional. We had a great time.  Tip:  on Sunday there was quite a bit of street parking available within a few blocks."
4,"For our first trip to America, me and my girlfriend wanted to see a sports game, we decided on Baketball, Nets v Celtics ..... I wasn't disappointed .... the staff at the Barclays centre were all friendly and helpful, the game and seats were good... the only problem with the Barclays centre was that I couldn't go into the official store because I had already left the building and could not come back in, good thing there was a NBA store In Manhattan where I got merchandise from"
2,No Parking at all very disorganized and confusing traffic impossible and very expensive for parking and entrance
2,"Well I decided to end my boycott and go see the NY Islanders at Barclays. Whoever designed that place did an awful job. And not just for hockey. The sight lines are poor, the 200 level seats are too steep, the sound system is unbalanced and the food vendors are untrained. I get to take this off my bucket list but I won't be back. I can say the place was clean."
4,Great venue with very good services  for food and drink. Seating for concerts provides ample views and comfort
5,"My wife and I aren't into basketball (we're English!), but it's still something I've always wanted to do, and I'd heard the Barclays Center is impressive. We went to a pre-season game v. Detroit Pistons. We absolutely loved every minute, the staff were great, the beer was good and the atmosphere was brilliant even though it was only half full. We also got well into the game and they now have another two Brooklyn Nets fans!"
4,"Barclays is a great place to see everything from basketball ,  hockey to a concert .I even saw Joel Olsten there"
4,"The arena has really a good ambiance for sports. We where there for a basketball match beween the Nets and the Knicks. The entree went quit well althought there where many people at ons time. The hall itself is impressive. Even from the top of the arena you have a good view. The building itself loods very new and clean. Not for a visit in iTS OWN, but certainly enjoyable when there is a match ."
5,"We were in NYC in early October and decided to take in an Islanders vs Rangers pre-season game at Barclays Center.  I'm a serious hockey fan (OK, I'm at least as serious of a hockey fan as you can be if you live in Houston, TX), so, I'd heard some of the chatter in the hockey world that the BC wasn't a really good hockey venue...some obstructed views, bad lighting at ice level in the corners, etc.  Well, we thought it was an excellent hockey venue.  Whatever issues they had with lighting seemed to be resolved, with all parts of the ice bright and well lit.  From our seats at mid-level/center ice (sorry, I had to throw that in there!), it didn't really look to me that there were many hockey seats with an obstructed view, but the Islander faithful have a better handle on this than I do.  The best part of the BC experience is its convenience to public transportation and the customer service staff.  There's a major metro station literally right outside the main BC entry.  The customer service staff at BC is simply one of the best I've experienced at a major event venue...ever. Friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable.  They just genuinely seemed to be happy that you were there and that they could help you.  Finally, the food options at BC looked outstanding.  That cheesecake the size of a cinder block looked tempting, but we ate dinner before the game.  Maybe next time."
5,"As a huge sports nut, I had to go see the home f the Nets and Islanders. What a modern marvel in design. I just wish thered been a tour available for it"
1,"Great atmosphere, had the promise to be a great evening out - just didn't happen...Be careful when ordering tickets on line venuekings. They have expensive tickets for the suites which are tagged SRO, which means you have to get out your seat if someone comes in with a standard ticket - we found out this out when we arrived and got asked to get out our seats and move to the back of the room ... 2 hours standing in a booth trying to get a glimpse of the game is quite tiring and took the edge of the $337 experience. Beware.."
5,This is truly Brooklyn finest. Repaired to get there early because Brooklynn's best restaurants are in there. Enjoy !
4,"Saw the circus with kids. Ring and seats were good, Staff was helpful and plentiful.Hard to find parking. Did not find elevator to Center from the subway."
1,"I've seen a few Cirque du Soleil shows [Mystere, O, La Nouba, Wintuk]. For the above average ticket prices, one expects to see stunts with increasing degrees of difficulty. Toruk, in my opinion, was a slightly better version of Wintuk, the worst CdS production. Toruk had a confusing introduction. Characters were speaking Klingon while the narrator told the story. Too much pageantry for my taste.  $160 plus for nosebleed seats, zero concession stands in the second floor for a 20-minute intermission, production lacked wow factor...need I say more?"
5,"Saw a Nets vs. North Carolina game. It was great, got free glow sticks to cheer them to a win!!! Please take public transportation, very congested, lots of foot traffic."
1,Don't go here unless you've eaten a full meal!! Food is overpriced. Don't even consider getting a beer or two. It'll set you back at least 20 dollars. So disappointed with this place. Good example of how Brooklyn is now though. Overpriced and being developed for the rich. I'll never bring my family to Barclays again.
1,"Messed up my Suite rental agreement. I saved up and spent a lot of money on a 30th birthday surprise. After confirming all details about the VIP meetup lounge/ bar before hand, they closed it without notice to anyone right before doors opened. Ruined the whole first part of the night. The also closed the original 40/40 club included in the suite package description without telling anyone. No notice. Denyed they did anything wrong. What a terrible experience. Don't waste your money on a VIP suite… That's all it is. A waste of money."
3,"As a season ticket holder, I have been to the Barclays Center a lot.  It was amazing at first - all the vendors are Brooklyn based, clean, friendly Disney trained (no joke) staffs. I think it's gone a little down hill but for those that have never visited before, you may not have anything to compare to. There a 40/40 club inside and almost all subway lines right there as well as LIRR."
4,The concert was fabulous our seat were awesome and the performances were fantastic! This is a nice venue and a cool exhibit.
5,"We saw Blake Shelton at the Barclays. An amazing concert at a really great venue. The seats were comfortable, excellent view and great accoustics. Beer and food was overpriced as you would expect, but tasty and well served."
5,"The place is very clean, seats have room for the knees...I'm 6'2"". I found the employees to be pleasant and seemed to like their jobs. Well made stadium..bathrooms modern and clean, walkways wide and clean. Food prices and drink prices outrageous. . However the area outside the Center...well......I wouldn't park too far away. Lots of construction and just not a good area to walk around."
4,Barclay center is a nice place... we went to see Toruk Cirque du soleil they utilized the whole center stage... it was a nice show!!! parking for this arena was a bit of a pain... make sure you plan ahead to find parking and still get to your show or sports event on time... enjoy!!!
4,"I've seen 2 shows here (NiN and Prophets of Rage) and both were incredible shows. The stage is massive and GA is as well. We hit the Billboard Lounge downstairs before the show to enjoy a couple of single malts. The lounge is nice, well decorated, comfortable, and is as pricey as it feels; but I guess that's to be expected... What really makes this place shine is how helpful the  staff was here. From the elevator attendants to client services, everyone was kind and willing to assist with anything we needed. We had some issues finding our VIP package pickup, and the staff, tho they didn't know the answers right off the bat, did everything in their power to help us out with a smile on their faces. Will be back for sure."
5,Was here for the festivities of WWE's Summerslam weekend and Barclays Center is much better and cheaper than MSG!!!
5,Was here for Summerslam. Had 200 level seats and could see everything. Beware the scalpels outside. Last year they were selling the same seat multiple times.
2,"I understand that this is the only true stadium built in Brooklyn whereby many events are occurring, however, the stadium was built as a shelter in the event a storm occurred in Brooklyn. With that stated it is built to occupy thousands of people at a time. Unfortunately, due to such concept, if one plans to go and see a concert in such a venue,I will tell you this, purchasing any seat other than the seats directly on the floor directly in the front of the stage, you will not see a thing clearly. The TV stands built to enable you to have a better view of the stage is way too far from the seats and for all five concerts I've attended there the screens were actually turned off. I weigh 130lbs and am 5'6 yet the chairs are so small, I can barely fit in them; the chairs are built for children not adults. If your seat is in the upper level be very cautious as the seats are built at an angle that if one happens to fall or trip, you're rolling all the way down possibly killing yourself. Despite all these horrible things stated the stadium is beautiful and many elite people have begun to be attracted to what Brooklyn has to offer. Events are held at the stadium throughout the days in a week. Parking is a hassle if you drive, the stadium has caused so much traffic as it was built in the heart of Brooklyn. There are several garages around for about $10 an hour during events but that gets expensive, it's like parking your car in the city. The beauty is that is however, located near all major trains such as the A,C,E, 1,2,3,4, and the N,M, B, Q as well as the New Jersey transit and the B41 etc. The idea of the stadium was great but it should have been built in a manner that caters to the events that are held there practically eveyday."
5,"i went for the first time to watch the show with performers from the Philippines. ASAP in New York. I was amaze with the huge venue that has 18103 seating capacity. The place was about 99% full. Food and drinks are sold at the venue like typical event places food are pricier. My friends and I brought our own food. Just some nicknacks. We were seated on row 109. There were 2 screens on the side but the screen in the middle is clearer but the rails are covering the the screen that you can't watch it on the screen. The Restrooms were clean and the cleaner is prompt to take the garbage out. For ladies, be prepare for a long line at the restroom."
4,"nice place  to  watch a  game, area  has  picked  up,  great  restaurants in  the  area, alot  of  culture and  fun  to  walk  around. get  to  your  event  a few  hours  early  and  explore  the  best of  brooklyn"
1,"What a waste of my Friday night and yes, i have seen many cirque shows to compare, at least 15 shows seen,this one is so boring to put it bluntly,blank canvas with projectors and the most boring acts, ever. It feels as if you are watching a movie on TV, no point in seeing this live. Was happy there were no silly clowns buying time also. Really slow, drawn out with a 20 min intermission, lol! Save your money, $107 for section 115 row 2 good seat waste of money and half the arena empty most areas rows of seats empty. I understand why cirque only did this show  for a couple nights!"
4,"Was my first time inside, it was amazing and beautiful.   The arena is an atrium and  we had tickets 3 rows from the top, steps were very steep and scary when looking down.  Seats were very narrow, food expensive and ticket prices are to high.  Otherwise the sights were nice, view even high was very good."
2,"This place is horrible. Service is horrible you buy bottles of water they sell it to you with no cap,  open it with dirty hands, and telling you its  the rule.  What kind of rule is that?  Then if you left your sit and went to the bathroom and did not take your ticket with you, tough luck they won't let you in saying its the rule. What kind of rule is that? I mean i have been to this place a lot of times before and experience THIS for the first time! One Good thing about Barclay's Center i must say they have a free wifi no password required."
5,"Been there last week for WWE Monday RAW, well organized easy process to enter , good refreshments vendors but extremely expensive Safe to go with family"
4,This great sports/concert venue is conveniently located right by several major subway/LIRR lines with many restaurants/shops nearby.
4,"I was at the Nets game where Joe Johnson hit the tying 3 pointer, and in overtime, the game winner! I also attended  other Nets games (I am even going to opening night and a Knicks vs Nets game.) And i also went to 2 islanders games. But note that some seats have obstructed views, especially on the lower level. I would recommend the middle or upper floors if you are going to an Islanders game. However, if you are going to a Nets game, obviously, there's no obstructed view in any seat. Now for the food, I recommend Williamsburg pizza on the lower level. And Barlcays center has a juniors cheesecake to go stand! Also, during Nets games, they sell chocolate cupcakes (which are huge) with the Nets logo on top! Now if only they could fix the obstructed view seating.. I would be more than happy to give this place 5 stars! But hey, let's go Nets!"
4,"The center is easy to find and entrance procedures were fast and easy. Drinks and snacks just as expensive as expected!Seats were section 212 row 1 and for the 'cheap seats' we were really pleased - great view and quality.At the end of the event exit procedures were a bit of a mess,everyone shepherded the same way but at the bottom of the escalator the phone charging station caused a severe bottleneck where people couldn't get off the escalator. Eventually somebody had to push the emergency stop button. Perhaps a steward at the top and bottom directing people would solve this issue.Overall though, a good, clean, modern venue and a great time had :)"
3,"Have been to Barclays Center on numerous occasions for different events like concerts, Rock and Roll induction, boxing, college basketball, pro basketball and hockey. Very good venue for all with the exception of hockey.The arena is easily accessible and extremely close to the subway. This has the worst food of any arena that I have been to. Plus, the kids who work at the concession stands are generally rude and incoherent. If you are going to an event at the Barclay Center,  I recommend you dine at one of the areas fine restaurants."
1,Went to JT show there and the place is just a mess.. Seats are uncomfortable and service is poor... Not worth a trip to Brooklyn..Parking is stupid and it seems out of place.. Won't go back there for a show..
4,"Great center, awesome reviews. Friendly staff. Would recommend anyone goes here, if their hosting an event your interested in."
5,"Organized to get in and out of. No wait time, no problems with entrance &amp; exit. Plenty of opportunities for merchandise and snacks with little wait time."
5,The Barclays impressed me more than I thought it would. We came to see WWE Raw last year and had seats in the highest section -- and we could still see plenty. The seats were comfortable too.
3,Not much to say really other than the venue is decent and its very easy to get around with helpfull staff .But the prices are some of the worst ive seen Almost $11 for less than a pint of Bud Light..... Terrible !!
5,"Loved, Loved, Loved the show.  Dream come true seeing her in concert.The Barclay Center was a great venue.  I had amazing seats.However I did not like the ushers not letting us taking pictures.  They were crazy.  I would go this venue again for a show.  Very easy getting to and from the show."
4,"Finally, got to see Barbra Streisand at the Barclay center.  We were seated in the heavens.  My complaint would be that the walk up the stairs was exhausting.  The view was OK.  I wish the screen would have been bigger."
5,"A great sports team is hard to find these days in NY (allthough the Knicks give it a shot this season). I went to see the Nets and it was a great, more local (than the Knicks) experience."
5,Loved the sound system. I was in the 220's area I could see everything clearly. Not the performers face but that was fine with us. We were happy to be fortunate enough to attend a concert. Bathrooms were clean. We did not buy anything to eat or drink prices were too steep for us. We had our water and power bars in our bag and got in with it. Seats were a lil tight but that was to be expected in NYC. We did not pay for parking we parked in a residential area a few blocks away. I'd suggest taking the train everything is accessible in that area.  Everything is well lit outside and inside very comfortable atmosphere.
5,Wonderful concert in a nice clean arena.  Easy access by car or subway.  Plenty of restaurants in area.  Really enjoyed my time in Brooklyn.
5,Have seen several productions at this venue. All seats seem to have good views.Plenty of places for snacks on the premises.
1,"went to 3 hour + wwe event. I can sit through 6 hours of wrestling if they go that long :) after about an hour I was pretty ready to leave. As is with all arenas and sporting areas, its only designed to make money, they care not about you. The seats are so incredibly close to each other its enough to make you crazy. my feet, legs, and knees felt so awful (Im like 5 6 or so, not exactly a giant) I minimally wanted to stand and walk around. I dreaded the oncoming hours and it ruined the show. I think Im officially over big venue shows."
4,Went to NXT Takeover Brooklyn Saturday night.  Conveniently located above the Subway Station.  Typical beer prices at $13 a pint.  But plenty of food stands around.  We had lower bowl seats so great view of the ring.  Sits were tight together. But it did not look like any seats would be that bad.  We grabbed Uber after the show and it wasn't too bad.1 issue we saw was the lines before the show outside were chaotic and not organized at all due to the way the barriers were run.
4,"Barclays is greatly located on one of the main metro hubs - thus easy to get here. There is shopping mall across the street and plenty of food options around, so save some bucks at otherwise expensive inside stalls. They have beer, wine, nonalcoholic bevies, hot dogs ect. When we were at the top rows, Basketball game was boring - we were too far. When we were at the second level and corner for the PLay Offs in Hockey, it was really good - and stil about 130usd, which is a lot, but good ratio price vs quality of seats."
4,I went there for a WWE event and was surprised by how well they organized it. Didn't have to wait in long queues. The security checks were quick. The subway is just opposite to the arena. Food inside was priced well. Overall a good experience
5,"I have attended Islander's NHL games with my wife and friends. I have also attended couple of NBA games with my son. The atmosphere is great just like other NBA stadiums. Easy access via MTA, better than average stadium food at reasonable prices. The n'hood is safe even at late night. The BAM is close by, shopping mall is across the street and tons of good restaurants. Indian food at Joy Restaurant or Kyoto Sushi is within walking distance and a great place for date on a budget."
4,This was a great venue for a concert. The place was comfortable- it was a super hot evening but the A/C was great. Sound was good for a concert. We had floor seats and they were a bit small &amp; close together. Like for the bathroom wasn't bad either! We drove but mass transportation seemed accessible.
5,"I am in love with the smell of Barclays!! I was in town for the Hillsong Conference so we were in and out for 3 days. Every time we walked in and out the smell made me so happy. I googled it, apparently it's their signature scent. I'm a fan!!"
4,"Easy  to get to. Seats too steep. Not enough screens to watch action. Like MSG and Pru Center better.Just saw barbara,Streisand left with a cramp in my neck as,seat directed in opposite direction from stage"
5,"I have attended two Barbra Streisand concert at the Barclay Center. Once soon after it opened four years ago and another this past weekend and  I have to give it up to the staff.  Everyone I have ever spoken with or dealt with in any way, primarily the usher staff, has bee nothing short of professional yet helpful and friendly.  Even as the crowd herder outside nat the concert, the staff was very pleasant.I wish I had gotten the names of a couple of the standouts but my memory fails me.Either way.  GREAT CREW!  Keep up the great work!"
4,"I visited Barclays Center, which was a few minutes' walk from my hotel, to see it for myself, and it's definitely a great-looking building. Though I didn't get to go inside, walking around outside was pleasant and there are a number of restaurants in the immediate area that sprung up after Barclays opened. It also houses the Atlantic stop for the N, Q and R trains, so it's convenient to commute to."
5,I have come here for several concerts. The seats for a place of this size are very comfortable and the place is clean. Even though it was very hot outside the ambient temperature inside was comfortable. Be aware that you should pre pay for parking since event parking can be expensive and it sells out quickly.
4,Went to the Barclay Center for the Streisand concert. First time there. Easy to reach on mass transit. Courteous staff. Excellent sound system. Pretty amazing venue all things considered.
1,It's new and it's beautiful.  The entrance was very poorly organized.  $15 per drink in a cheap plastic cup is a rip off.  Restrooms poorly placed for the poor souls in the nose bleed section.  Very steep and cramped when you get to your seats.
4,Facility is big and quite nice.  Getting to this facility is tough but after event is ridiculous.  Crowd control is among the worst event venues I've ever been at.  If you are not VIP or handicap you are in a proverbial cattle-call.  The subway is 10 lbs in a 5 lb bag.  Forget looking for a cab.  Finding an Uber or car is difficult.  Stay 45 minutes in the stadium before venturing out.   Saw Streisand.  Sound system just OK.
4,"Just attended for the first time a concert at the Barclays Center and was very pleasantly surprised at how clean, modern and pleasant the facility was.  Even the security folks were nice!  Lots of food and drink choices within the facility.  Conveniently located to mass transit.  The area is very well patrolled and feels very safe for people of all ages.  Look forward to our next event there!  As far as seating for a concert front floor center is the best if you can get it.  We were first row side and while comfortable did give me a neck ache after 2.5 hours.  Special note they were very accommodating to the elderly and handicapped."
5,I wound up finding a parkingvspit a block away. Grtting inside and finding my seat was easy. The srats were comfortable and the place is really nice. Im proud to have it in Brooklyn!
4,Great venue for a concert. Acoustics and sound system is right on. Staff very friendly. Subway system at entrance. All pluses. Leaving is atrocious. Small corridors from arena and not enough exit gates. Awful. I was shocked by the exit system. Don't know how it got approved.
5,The Barklays Centre is one attraction which can not be missed if you are in Brooklyn ! The location and the easy access makes this place a Mecca for the shopoholicks  and the tourists alike . The numerous outlets offer the sheer amazing veriety for anyone with an eye for a quick purchase . The eateries dotted along are welcoming and offer the amazing fares . Worth a visit . Easy aeccess by public transport bus / underground .
4,"Firstly it's been a really long time since I've been to this part of Brooklyn and really didn't know what to expect.  We were fortunate enough to have a suite for the Florence and the Machine American tour and made our way in from NJ with friends.  The drive was surprisingly quick and parking was plentiful and immediate proximity to the venue (!shocked!).  There are also a dozen other public transportation means by which you can quickly get in and out to this area.  Heavily gentrified over the last decade this is a hustling and bustling melting pot with a vibrant, fun and enjoyable assortment of restaurants and shops.  The Barclays center itself is well designed, the venue presented well and the acoustics were great for the concert. Getting in and out was a breeze - shockingly efficient (much unlike our disastrous experience at MetLife with Coldplay later this summer).  Loved the neighborhood and the venue and will return as often as we can now that we know how easy it is to get in and out ..."
4,e were lucky we got the full of day tour. It was cool to the mechanical of the building.A great place to sit and veg/
5,"First time at the Barclays to see a concert - great venue, security lines very organized.  The food services available were also good.  Made going to a concert very enjoyable."
2,"Went to see Barbra Streisand and sat in the upper level. The climb is very steep, and for the concert, the screen was blocked from our view by a hanging speaker.  Ok I'll deal. The rows are very narrow, difficult to move even while others are standing. A lady tripped in our row and was hurt. There was no staff anywhere to offer assistance.I hope there never will be any type of emergency I, but I won't be back.."
4,Easy to get to from Manhattan using subway and no fears getting back to hotel same way. Staff friendly but food and alcohol extremely expensive
3,Well my most recent visit to Barclay center was for a concert to New Edition and Baby Face. My girlfriend had gotten us tickets to celebrate my birthday. My seats this time around were decent compared to the time I first visited many years ago. I promise myself I wouldn't come back there if I had to sit in the nose bleed section. The seats way up are not designed for you to stand up and enjoy the show because the floor feels uneven. It feels like you could fall forward. You have to spend the money if you want the best seats. Don't know if they have screens or not but they were not in use for those of us who didn't have front and center seats to see the artist. If I never go back there again I will be just fine.
3,"Saw a game here, exiting the arena is a nightmare, slow and hard to get out of this place. Friends have enjoyed concerts here but complain of the same thing. Like all arenas especially in the NYC area it is expensive in the arena and around the arena. Eat before you go."
5,I went to this place to see a circus and a Demi Lovato concert. It's a nice place but it really does get crowed so if you have small kids be careful. There they had food and souvenirs. The seats are good but for the concert everyone was standing a lot so if you have small children it might be kind of hard to see. Overall it's a nice place for family's.
5,To watch the Brooklyn Nets play against the best Teams in the world is one of the best things you can do!
4,"Went to the Babyface/New Edition concert in July 2016 and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The venue was very clean, well designed, plenty of Food&amp;Beverage options, comfy seats and easily accessible via subway. Sound quality was good and the crowd thoroughly enjoyed the performances.The only complaint - the A/C was set to freezing temp. I noticed that many  people put on cardigans and scarfs, so it was definitely not only me. I guess they expect everyone to be dancing and feeling hot, but hey, not every song is upbeat. :-)Nevertheless, I would definitely attend any concert/game at this venue again."
4,"The actual concert was awesome.  The Barclay Center is a very nice arena,  very easy to find your seats.  The only complaint, the parking was expensive, and the lines when leaving were extremely long."
4,"I went to ""The Who"" concert in the Spring of 2015. I wasn't happy about the extremely long lines and having my dinner and snacks taken away from me when the staff searched my bag as I was starving. The staff was rude and gruff. I was told I could buy food inside to replace what was seized and tossed in the trash. Thanks guys!The concert was awesome despite my growling hunger and the building was massive. I didn't buy any food inside as it didn't appear too appetizing."
4,New and cool. I have seen several concerts and all were good experiences. Easy transit and lots of nearby dining choices.
4,"I was here for the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, and while the outside is less than appealing to many, Barclays offers many features of a luxury / upscale sporting venue.  Box seats offer individual televisions to view the action.  The stadium has good acoustics, and there are a number of private meeting rooms for business meetings, receptions, or private viewings of events."
4,The venue is really nice. I'm not a fan of any of the teams that plays there but I've been here for a graduation and a concert and I was impressed both times I was there. The staff moves the crowds in pretty quickly and they have a lot of food options
5,Thanks Barclays Center for making me fall in love with ice hockey absolutely brilliant arena and good views of the stadium we went to see New York Islanders vs Pittsburgh Penguins and was just awesome and already planning to go again
5,"The Barclays Center has been written about as having made the most money of all the stadiums in 2015 in the USA.  It is home to two teams, the basketball team The Nets and icehockey team The Islanders.Also, there are fabulous concerts where the acoustics is wonderful such as Neil Diamond and Barbara Streisand."
5,Attended a concert in June and it was our first time at barclay s and it won't be our last.  We parked at a near by garage and walked over to the center.it was a nice neighborhood and easy to get to. Staff was wonderful .Security was organized and quick.Loads of staff to help you find your way around. Everyone was friendly and helpful. I think it was the cleanest concert venue I have ever attended. Very positive experience
5,Great venue for viewing shows and sporting events. Good security checkpoints. Food is pricey but that's to be expected in New York.The private viewing boxes  can hold at least  12 people comfortably. Caps have to be removed from bottled beverages for players' safety....how funny and sad at the same time....can't we all just get along and be as civilized as a kindergarten class can be?
5,"We went to the Barclays Center to the concert of Bruce Springsteen, ""The River"". We sat way up high and the sound was great. Getting in and out of Barclays was quite easy and smooth. Do not hesitate to go :)"
5,"Don't be turned off by the security lines. Once you get in, it's a beautiful venue for anything you will see.  The sound is great- there is no bouncing of sound off walls.  It's cheaper than anything at MSG, and you can get there by a million subway lines to Atlantic Station. Plus there's a shake shack across the street!"
5,Went here for the Martin Lawrence comedy show and loved the seats and arrangement of the auditorium. The security were spaced thoroughly throughout the building and very helpful.
5,A good place to visit in Brooklyn. You heard. All types of things from basketball games to hockey games. All around fun to visit
1,"Went with 4 kids and 3 adults handicapped ! Was placed in handicap section (adults were) .  Teenagers next to us told us no one  handicap daddy bought these seats more leg room for them ! People around us smoking pot! And since section over booked we have to move not to section next to us wide open but across theater while Joe Jonas is singing ! Our kids above us had to move with us of course so missed must of Joe! They (the staff was really nasty ) and told us your moving girls can stay even though they were honest not handicapped!!!! And seats were open all over ! I begged this was a lot and I want my daughter happy! Please ! Too bad! Usher was not understanding and wheelchair driver kept saying this is messed up !!! Really disappointed and shocked with Barclay staff!!!! My friend asked for ADA person , they don't have one !!!! Another lie !!!"
4,"Very nice indoor arena, modern and clean.  There are many refreshments available of all kinds at many concessions, including an L&amp;B Spumoni Gardens!!You can also get a variety of adult beverages for those interested. Bathrooms are clean, modern and plentiful, not too bad of a wait in the ladies room. I hate when there's not enough facilities for a venue. We saw the Nets vs Indiana Pacers in December 2014 during Christmas, and had a nice time. Ladies, do not wear high heels. The steps are steep, and narrow.  Much steeper than. Usual in a stadium, a flaw in my consideration.The bigger drawback is the extremely cramped seating. Very tight and definitely not too comfortable. They could have done a better job on the leg and elbow room. Unless you're under average size, don't expect to be sitting too comfortably."
5,"Went to see a Islanders hockey game with my family and really loved this place.  It's brand new, beautiful and really nice.  All the staff are super friendly."
5,"What a beautiful facility.  I've been to many arenas around the country and this one is spectacular.  From the striking exterior to the clean interior to the many food choices.  For games, concerts, family events - this is one beautiful facility!"
5,"Saw Bruce Springsteens last concert of 2 in Barclays Center. Great experience both the concert and the venue.Easy to get in to the arena, lots of different food choices, drinks and other refreshments.Nice and clean arena with clean toilets!!!Worth a visit even if you´re not going to a concert or game."
4,"We came to Brooklyn to watch the Warriors as we were on holiday from England and it was our chance to see the current champions and Steph Curry. We were sat in the top tier and despite reviews saying it is too steep, I actually think this helps give a better view than normal arenas and I'm not good with heights but I was fine with this. It was very busy and queued before the game and we only just made tip off but I guess this is because the Warriors were in town.  I thought there could have been more toilets as it was a bit of a trek at half time to get to the nearest one and I got caught in the crowds buying food so missed the start of the 2nd half. I'd recommend not getting food at half time as the queues were ridiculous and you will miss a lot of the game.  A great game to watch though as the Nets actually led in the 3rd quarter but the Warriors came back to keep up their unbeaten start to the season.  Very much enjoyed our first NBA game as my girlfriend wasn't even keen on going but afterwards was converted and loves it!"
5,"We had a fantastic trip here to watch the New York islanders. The Barclay's Center is easy to get to using the subway from Midtown. Despite the huge queues we got inside really quickly and there was a good selection of food, drink and souvenirs. Well worth a visit for ice hockey fans! We will definitely be returning in the future!"
5,Came here to watch the Islanders and was a great venue (My first Ice hockey game) enjoyed the atmosphere and was easy to get drinks during the game and also going to the clubshop to get merchandise after the game.
4,"Walking less than a mile from friends' home is real nice right there.  Electric atmosphere with fast, exciting Islanders hockey. Fun crowd activities, video, food choices. Go Sharks!"
5,Really great venue. Dropped my 16-year-old and her friend off right at the VIP entrance for a Selena Gomez concert and waited with them until they could go in. The staff was highly organized and signed them in while they were in line and kept checking on new arrivals. Very well done. I was able to sit outside the venue and wait for them and felt safe. No one bothered me at all. The girls came out and met me by Starbucks outside when the concert was over. No worries at all. I would attend a concert here again.
4,"As I used to live right down the street, I've been to a number of events here–from concerts to basketball to hockey. Overall it's a beautiful venue. It's very clean and super modern. There are a lot of food and beverage options and it's easily the most accessible place in the entirety of NYC (N,B,D,Q,R,2,3,4,5 and LIRR are all at the front door).Cost-wise, it's high. Take what you're used to in terms of tickets and food costing at a venue and add 25%. After all, it is New York. Also, the surrounding neighborhood is delightful, and 5th ave (right around the corner) is chock full of great bars and restaurants for a pre-game snack or a post-game drink. Overall, a solid venue."
2,"After attending the Bad Boy reunion concert, i was totally disgusted at the numerous ppl lighting up (getting high), my eyes were on fire and my hair smelled. Ppl were in there fighting and called mgmt b/c of all the smoke and was tired of it. Dude in next row even had a cigarette. What a freaking disgrace and they should act on it asap, b4 someone has a major asthma attack"
1,Until they provide housing as developer Ratner stated not going to purchase any tickets or go to Barclays.  Barclay where is the housing at.....
2,Am very late with this post but I decided to give my opinion.  My hubby took me to a basketball game - Nets vs Bulls. Unless you can afford seats that are lower its just horrible.  It's not comfortable either it would have been better to watch the game at home.  Whoever designed the structure failed.
3,"The center is Not made for Live Singing Concerts!! It's a Sports Complex! Point Blank Period! The monitors are too low for the higher rows. I was in section 210 row 11. Along the left side of stage! We could Not understand ANYTHING the artist said while talking to the audience! The stage is not centrally located the speaker system SUCKS!! $$$ WASTED! The concession stands are awesome! You can get anything, food, liquor, snacks. The Prices are just what you expect! It's all good between shows but when you spend $90+ for tickets you at least want the full sound effects! Go see basketball or hockey but unless you're dead center or the ground floor.. It's not worth the money."
4,"Saw ""the River"" concert here, always a great show!! Drinks are pricey but typical of most concert venues. We sat behind the stage but had a good view as well as a jumbo screen."
2,"Well I took my family there four an outing of hockeyThe facility is fantastic and very convenient especially traveling from the islandMy only major disappointment was the food for also being a Mets fan I have become used to some amazing eats at citi fieldNot being Jewish but I will say the Jewish deli at Barclays Center was probably be best food availableThey need to take some major steps to improve the quality of the food for the venue is outstandingMy son being a lover of chicken fingers was very disappointed with them and he is not one to be choosy for chicken fingersI know there are other options available, which we will try next go-round, but in other newer venues they have found the secrets to exceeding patrons expectations when looking for a bite to eatHopefully by next season they can find someone local joints to take up residence in the centerAs a side note the red wine was very fulfilling and was truly unexpected"
4,"The Barclays center is a fantastic place for any large event. I went there the see the Martin Lawrence show. It was a full house. We had perfect seats. They have several different spots to eat. And good and drink stands, and best of all they have Nathan's. Was a great experience."
5,Amazing show and venue. A bit on organized upon entering venue. I liked the futuristic feel of the building.Beer prices were too expensive. Did not see food prices.
5,"Barclays Center is very big with a lot of food concessions, beer station and a nice place to meet friends for an event."
4,The arena is incredible. The configuration is amazingly impressive. The bowl is so steep that on higher levels it is possible to get vertigo.
4,"I came to Brooklyn to watch my Mountaineers play in the NCAA tournament. Even though we had a shocking upset loss I still have to say this is a nice venue. The outside is very beautiful. And the subway entrance is right by the doors. It does not have a history that the garden hose, but it is a very nice modern stadiam. Even from the upper levels you can still see very well. If you ever get the chance to watch a basketball game here I would highly recommend it."
1,"The place was nice and very organized and obviously a lot of space but my complaint was they over charged you for all there food since they don't allow ANY outside food to be brought in, not even a granola bar.  The basic bottle water was $5.50 !!!!!   That is completely out of line and taking advantage of the people.  Our meeting started at 8am and ended at 4pm so you had no choice but to pay for there way over priced food and drinks or just starve to death.You could not leave the building and if you did, you're not allowed back in.   Truly pathetic."
4,"Recently attended a concert at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.   Took the Q from the Times Square subway station downtown to the Atlantic Ave - Barclays Center stop.  The subway trip took about 20 - 30 minutes.   The subway stop in Brooklyn brings you directly to the front of the Barclays Center.   The ride is convenient and safety is a non issue.  The area surrounding the arena appears to contain mostly retail shopping businesses. The Arena, which is now the home of the Nets and Islanders, is new, clean, well-staffed, and comfortable.   While my seats were in the lower level, the site lines all appeared to be good.   I definitely recommend attending an event at the Barclays Center and use the public transportation to get there."
4,"Watched my beloved New York Islanders do battle against the Philadelphia Flyers.  This was my second trip to BC and it remains a mixed bag.  The good:  It is fun to visit Downtown Brooklyn, visited Junior's before the game.  The arena remains odd for hockey with about 40% of the seats with some limited view."
2,"The Barclays Center is a nightmare.  A nightmare that in 10 years people will wake up and wonder what the heck they were thinking by building this arena.The Cheap seats are cheap with no leg room.  I think they were aiming for hip and cool but it's dark and a bit dreary inside with many areas of concrete cracking.  The exterior could have been interesting if they had placed the entire arena at the West End of Atlantic Avenue where it's rusted hull would be a better artistic curiosity with plenty of parking and a means for the city to have made money on the over abundance of available land for over priced parking spaces or speck NY Waterways Taxis for event transportation.  Instead this rusting hulk has sealed off many mom and pop businesses and created a nightmare for any tourists or residents who really want to go and see a concert here.  Ticket prices are out of this world.  I wanted to see Billy Joel for Christmas and for the cost of one ticket here, I purchased 3 tickets and saw him at the Amalie Arena in Tampa a few weeks later.  Don't waste your money going here."
4,Saw a concert here on a Saturday night.  Comfy seats even in the 200 level. Good sound and spacious walkways.  Only drawback was the $12 beer and $14.75 mixed drinks.  Other than that of t was a great experience.
4,"I love to go to concerts or other stuff in USA. Barclay has it all, good space so you dont have to be in a long line before entering, they serve beer and lots of food. You have wifi. And we sat very high up but could see very good anyway! We saw bruce Springsteen 25 april 2016, amazing!"
4,"Just got back from seeing Bruce Springsteen. Great  concert and a really nice venue. Sound was good, lighting and acoustics were god as well. Food and beer is available in abundance but be prepared to pay for it. Beers were $10."
5,"We went to the Springsteen concert at the Barclays center, our first time at this new stadium. The layout was easy to navigate, and having a member of our group in a wheelchair, it was great to see that they had several family bathrooms and easily accessible and close to the accessible seating. The staff at the center was great from the man outside directing people to the proper entrance, to the lady who scanned our tickets and to the ushers. Every employee we had contact with were friendly, courteous, and Smiled- management be proud of your employees they all treated us great!"
5,"I have visited The Barclays Center for basketball, concerts and hockey. The arena is perfect, the staff when entering are cordial and informative! I love the setup in the arena, I have not been in a bad seat. The food court that surrounds the main floor is excellent, a true flavor of Brooklyn."
4,"It doesn't matter where he plays, he's The Boss!  But this review is really about the venue.  Getting through security was easy and quick, everything is well marked and if you take the subway, the stop is right there.  Every seat has a good view, unless you were behind the stage.  Climbing over people with cup holders so close to the ground was a challenge and going up and down the steps was difficult for some.  If you don't mind paying through the nose for drinks - $6 for a small soda, $5 for a bottle of water - you're good."
5,"We had good seats, the Show was very good. The Barclay Center is very nice and we had a good time. If you need parking you can park in the Mall or Shopping Center across the street. You can always buy you Starbucks before going in, but they will not let you take your coffee inside."
5,"Modern, centrally located, lots around, lots transportation methods to get here. Shops and restaurants all around and Starbucks in front!  Springsteen show tonight and there's always big acts performing here as well as many sporting events. A real good addition to the community. Lots new condos popping up in area as things modernize here. Good venue"
5,"We ventured out to Barclays Center to see Duran Duran, easy to get to by swapping onto the 4 subway and coming up at the centre. Before the concert we headed to Habanas for Mexican corn cobs just a 5 minute walk away. Concert is in a great space, not too big so you really connect to the performers great night out"
4,"We went here and visited a game of the NY Islanders and we had a blast. Since we are from Holland this was kind of new to us, but what show this was. From the moment we entered here it was a blast! Not to mention the game was awesome and the Islanders won, so what more do we wanted! When visiting NY make sure you visit this place!"
5,"Recently came to see the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction and was really impressed with both the facility and the people involved with the Barclay Center.  Courteous and professional,  there was not a staff person I encountered that didn't go out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and having a great time.  Kudos to the designers and employees of this great venue.  Coming back to see the ""Boss"" later this month."
4,"We came to the Barclays Centre twice during our stay in New York. We watched both the New York Islanders and the Brooklyn Nets. Both of the games were thoroughly enjoyable and the venue was perfect with comfy seats, good facilities and great views. Tickets were well priced and there is a subway right outside the center which allows for quick and easy to and from Manhattan."
3,"Large indoor venue for Nets, Islanders, concerts, etc.  There is a severe slope up, so if in ""cheap seats"", you are pretty high up. Found I was looking at screen instead of court for basketball because was so high up. Drinks, food expensive."
5,Went to the Barclays to watch the islanders v tampa bay lightening......first hockey game ever ffor me and my son but good god it was amazing!.......from the fellow fans who were so fun to be around to the brutality of some of the play....I love ice hockey....we won 5-2 and everyone went home happy as larry
5,"Barclay Center is a great new arena. Well laid out with virtually no ""bad"" seats. Good variety of food options including kosher and halal food. Staff very friendly and helpful. Very safe and user friendly.  Do not drive. Repeat do not drive. No place to park. Many subway lines serve this arena so there is really no need to drive."
3,"Nice building, easy to get to on the subway from Grand Central. However the concessions  offered were very poor. Only one food vendor with very slow serving times and poor service/selection. Their condiment table was out of the essential ingredients Mustard/Ketchup.  The bar across the way was so over priced, $13.50 for a draft beer. So the Gloves were great but the amenities offered at least that evening were poor. Will try again for some major event. Enjoyed Being in Brooklyn. Patsy's is just down the street from the arena which I highly recommend. Great food, attentive service, a wonderful bar tender."
5,First time on NHL game in my life so I'll never forget it. Center is really good but little bit expensive beer :-D I hope I'll be back soon again from Slovakia!!! Great place to enjoy the game I love that much!
4,"We found the arena very easy to get to from Upstate Ny, lots of parking options just a short walk away. We parked about a 10 minute walk away for under $25. We had good seats with good views of the game in and end section. Arena is a little dark and took only a few minutes to figure out the layout and find all we needed! Store was great and not hugely overpriced. Food is arena food, slightly overpriced, but that's o be expected at any sporting event."
3,"This place is a bit confusing to get around and the food and drinks are grossly over priced. Sight lines aren't great for hockey, crowd was dead for an important divisional match. Nice and new though, easy to access by subway."
3,"We will probably go back again but it's not my first choice for a concert. There are a dozen or more places I'd go to first. A really long line to get into the venue, held up by too few metal detectors. It's really quite dark, it'd be better if they painted the outer halls a lighter color. I'd say it's a better venue for sports than for a concert. Everything is expensive which was not unexpected. As you can tell it wasn't a thrilling first impression."
4,"I visited The Barclay's Center with my siblings two evenings in a row back in February.  Firstly for the Islanders v Capitols NHL game and for the Nets v Knicks NBA game the following night. I'm from the UK and this was my first time experiencing the NHL or NBA live. Our tickets were in the gods so I was worried we weren't going to get a great view of the action. I needn't have worried, I don't think there's such thing as a bad view in the arena! Both games were entertaining, the atmosphere was more electric for the Nets v Knicks game. I found the arena accessible, easy to navigate, safe and secure. There was plenty of good entertainment between stoppages in the game, and the stores within the arena were stocked with a great range of clothing and souvenirs. My only complaint was with the food. It wasn't good value or quality. My hot dog was cold and the potato chips tasted like cardboard. Eat before you go to the game, there are some great restaurants across the road. We ate at Patsy's Italian Pizzeria, which I can highly recommend."
5,Went to Islanders Sabres game. Nice place to watch hockey. We we in lower level. Good food choices and pricey beers. Easy to get too.
2,"First off, you better have good balance because walking down the row will require it. So many fans have commented on this. Barclay Center was a big idea in a smaller space and the result is not enough bathrooms, and bars, and seating is tight and walking down your row is hazardous.But the real rip off, is that the beer they sell is low alcohol. That's right your bud your coors your Heineken is all low alcohol beer. They don't tell you that. I know this from being on a cruise. You will not get a high or a hangover from this fake beer, so you might as well buy water. One 24 0z can of low alcohol Coors Bud is $13.75. What a rip off. But this is stupid New York City. Hockey is a beer event. No real beer. Well, no beer sales."
5,This is a world class venue. The entry process was quick and it's easy to find seats. Toilet facilities and food/drinks are a plenty so there wasn't many lines. Seats are more spacious and comfy than most other stadiums/venues than I've been to
3,"I am a huge Islanders fan and went to their final season game on April 10th. It was my first time at the Barclays Center and I was hoping for something great. The ticket scanner was really welcoming and nice. But that's just about it. We walked around the lower level and then the upper level (where our seats were) and they didn't have a good place for us to just sit and enjoy our dinner. We decided to eat at the burger place right near our section. The workers didn't seem to have it together. They said it would be a 10 minute wait for our burger. Mine was done before my dads. On the menu it says it comes with cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles and the Barclays sauce, but when I got mine all it had was the cheese. Turns out we had to go to the concession stand for all the extras. That was ok, but then I ordered a Bud Light on draft and the tap either wasn't working or they ran out mid-pour. It's only an hour before the game. How are these things not checked? There was no Barclays burger sauce at the amenities stand either. My dad ordered a burger with fries, thinking we'd get a lot so I just got a burger, but we only got maybe 20 fries. So for $47 two small burgers and some fries was not worth the price, but the beer was a nice size. We had good seats in section 209 and the arena itself was very nice. However, we were in the Wheel Chair area and there was a huge rail blocking our view. Thank god the chairs were movable so I pulled right up to the rail and looked over so as not to have it in my view. The workers didn't watch our section for people coming in like all the other section entrances so we had to show our tickets three times. Very annoying. The sound was great. The hallways really were no bigger than the Nassau Coliseum and the workers didn't seem thrilled to be there, but they were nice.  I went into the women's room and one worker was hiding out texting on her phone. The bathrooms were big and clean so no complaints about that. Overall, for a Long Islander the Barclays isn't anything worth trekking 40 minutes to unless its a playoff game. Islanders please come back to the Coliseum when your contract is up! We miss you!"
2,"I had to go to the Barclays Center for  a concert. It was my first time there, and hopefully my last time there. Of course, one cannot bring food or beverages into the venue. Why?Well, so they can gouge you!I am a diabetic. I am thirsty frequently. Once past the security check, I headed for the first concession stand. I ordered a bottle of Dasani and a Diet Coke. The water was $5.50 for 20 ounces. The Diet Coke was $6 for the same amount. I did not want to drink either beverage right away -- I wanted to have them at the ready for when I was thirsty without having to walk to the concourse mid-concert. The woman who sold me the beverages started twisting off the aps after she took my money.""What are you doing,"" I exclaimed.""You can't keep the bottle caps,"" she told me. I had never heard of anything so ridiculous. I asked her why, but she had no clue. I ended up only buying the Dasani and later did have to go back to the concourse to buy the Diet Coke. I truly felt violated. Not only was I forced to pay an exorbitant amount for glorified tap water and later diet soda, but I did not even have the ability to decide when to drink it, or to take any unfinished beverages with me. I seemed like for a few hours I had left America and entered some fascist stronghold."
3,"Went to the rock n roll hall of fame induction ceremony. Greeted by protesters as soon as we got off the subway blocking the entire entrance chanting ""Brooklyn is not for sale""! Subway was super easy. Escalator broken so had to huff it up all those stairs to the 200 level not good. 200 level seats are super steep and you really couldn't get around anyone so once we got seated there was no getting up. Someone actually fell down several rows on top of others in our section. !$13.50 for a plastic cup of beer. Really!!!! Ridiculous. Show was pretty awesome though. Had a great time."
5,"The Barclays Center is in a great location. I love the darkness, its very intimate. All Black Everything. We went to the Brooklyn vs. Orlando game in 01/2016. Concession stands were very good. Lots of food and drink options."
1,"Wanted to see a NBA game whilst we were in NYC and as the Knicks were expensive so we went for Nets tickets. I'd been to WWE at Madison Square Garden the night before and had a great time and I was really looking forward to visiting the Barclays Center. On arrival we were through security in minutes and went for something to eat and a beer. Chicken tenders and chips, 10 dollars, okay standard price at an arena but yuk! Inedible didn't want a massive dentist bill so I just ate the chips.....when I tried to get a beer I was I.D'd, cool same happened at MSG, you're not American they said in MSG have you got a credit card in the same name, yep, thanks here's your beer.....the Barclays Center on the other hand have you got I.D, even tho I'm 35 and was with my wife, yep here you go...sorry can't serve you, have you got a US I.D?? No I'm English?? Okay sorry no beer!! WHAT A JOKE! Anyway I'd drunk quite a bit the night before so I thought okay whatever.  We then go to watch the game...no atmosphere, boring and I wanted a drink so we left at the end of the 3rd.Moral of the story you pay low prices you get a poor arena, pay the extra and go watch the Knicks, Madison Square Garden was FAR better!! plus the Knicks aren't near the bottom!"
5,"Barclays Center is a nice venue, tickets are expensive at the box office, we paid $170 each for concert seats in not the best viewing area, try Stubhub first"
3,"I have been to barclays twice,once to see a wrestling match and the other to see il volo in concert.I like it since it is convenient to home.however the lightining is dark"
3,"I have to preface what I write below , I am an Islanders fan and a huge fan of the Old Barn on Long Island. My review shows that will never change.In 2015 I attended a Concert at the venue and was not impressed. Yes it's new, yes it has a lot of bathrooms, food choices and did I mention New? Not enough to impress me. That said I took my son for an Islanders game. Bought tickets on the secondary market (Prices are crazy the normal way). Bought tickets in a suite (A57). Arrived at Arena, most of the staff was very friendly (you always have some that don't want to be there, and have no problem showing you that!) security was quick and smooth, went up the suite level. It was really clean and open.the Suite sat 14, with a TV a small sitting area, and then two rows of 4 seats and a row of three high back seats over looking the rink.. We secured our seats and went for food. Two choices close by. A burger,hot dog place and Mexican. Food is ok, the usual Arena stuff, prices are what you would expect. One cup size (small $6)made me laugh though. Did not use the bar but it looked well stocked and pricey. Back to the seats. Was fun in the suite, Sightlines wer ok. You are not close to the ice. But that big video board shows the game so you could watch it there(just want I want to pay for) I chose my seats so I wasn't in the upper deck, was good enough for us and made for a good night. I am not happy this is the Islanders new home. It wasn't built with hockey in mind, the rink is not centered and there are a lot of limited view seats, so when buying tickets keep that in mind.Pros -new, clean, friendly staff, close to Public TransportationCons- not a Hockey arena, lots of bad Sightlines, sound acoustics bad, parking is almost non existent ."
3,"Went to my first Islanders game at Barclay's Center which looks beautiful on the outside! Also nice inside yet we had reservations for the 40/40 Club prior to the 7:00PM game time, and weren't allowed into the building until 6:00PM- would've liked to enter 15-30 minutes earlier to have time to leisurely eat and watch pre-game practice.  Although you can sit and watch from 40/40 area, you are totally unable to see from the hash lines to the goal, on the side you are sitting! Terrible design!! Our seats were upper deck- and these are really high nose-bleed seats! You also are somewhat screened at times and need to look at video scoreboard- not good! I honestly can't see Islanders staying here very long (I've heard they have an option to leave after 4 years) unless they do major renovations, which is unlikely??"
3,"My husband and I were here for the NCAA tournament a few weeks ago.  We parked our car overnight in a garage across the street which was super cheap and convenient - and only paid the event rate which was around 34$ (being from Boston...we considered this VERY cheap!) We had to pick up our tickets at will-call which was pretty confusing, there wasn't really anyone directing people and we only figured out from overhearing a woman tell someone else that we were standing in the wrong line.  The food and drinks were ridiculously overpriced, which wasn't a surprise. The MOMENT we walked in I noticed it smelled like someone went overboard with their Axe Body spray... The smell lingered through the night, and we finally came to the conclusion that it was being pumped out of the vents.  They have a Calvin Klein lounge... so we figured it was some CK fragrance but it really smelled terrible and gave me a headache.My husband bought 2 tickets online and selected the option that they were together... when we got there we realized that the seats were numerically together but they were on either side of the exit... so we really weren't next to each other. Luckily there were empty seats and he was able to move behind me.  Summary of my trip... Plenty of places to park, don't expect to get food or drinks for under 10$ and be prepared for it to smell like a bro party.  Oh and if you want to sit next to someone, you better make sure you're not near an exit."
4,Booked cheap last minute tickets for an Islands game. We were on the back row of block 210 but still had a great view. Atmosphere at the game was greatBit of security before entry but not too bad. Not able to take any food or drink into event but prices inside whilst on the steep side are not as bad as BroadwayBarclays has excellent access to subway system so able to get on train home straight after event
4,My tickets were pretty cheap especially to see the Cleveland Cavs which are one of the most popular teams in the NBA. I had nosebleeds but didnt need binoculars to see lol I liked the different vendors in the arena which just about all of them sold Nathans hot dogs and fries which a staple of the borough of Brooklyn. The staff was very helpful throughout the arena and allowed ppl to take pictures from different parts of the arena even though their seats were in a different section.
3,Went to the Barclay's Center for the first time for a school trip to see the Atlantic 10 Tournament. It's not MSG but it's nice. Clean. Many venders. A bit overpriced. Would be interested in seeing the Nets play but I'd be sure to eat at the Shake Shack ahead of time.
3,"Better smuggle in your own drinks because this place is a rip off... 10$ for a beer... I can buy myself a crate of real, Belgian beer for that."
4,What a great place to take the family for an enjoyable basketball or hockey game.   Great food but limited viewing from some seats in the balcony.  Make sure you ask before buying THOSE seats.   Lots of restrooms and very convenient to the Trains.    The security slows down the entry but that's the kind of world we live in now I suppose.    Really nice personnel.
1,"Great facility, but No beer for NCAA games? Wassup with that?Very pleasant experience, friendly staff."
5,"Located in busiest Hub in Downtown of Brooklyn, Atlantic Terminal it's a big shopping center, big LIRR terminal and busiest subway station with 10 lines.Nearby is booming devepments of 30-50 stories high residential towers, many restaurants, located in Downtown Brooklyn and nearby DUMBO neighborhoods. NEARBY is Fulton Avenue pedestrian mall, new developments of City Point, Grand Army Plaza and Prospect Park. The Arena, 15,500 seats, fully enclosed, is major Brooklyn Sport and Entertainment Complex, is second big after Madison Square Garden in Manhattan, sits on one of busiest intersections in Brooklyn, Flatbush Avenue, Atlantic Avenue and Fourth Avenue. Just across the Barclay's Center, is First True Skyscraper in Brooklyn, built in 1929, now is ranked only 6, after 50+ stories towers built in 2009-2015 and all located in Downtown of Brooklyn, who developed his own True City Skyline. AREA NEARBY IS PRETTY SAFE, BUT AT NIGHT, IT'S A NYC, YOU SHOULD KNOW. SAFE, BUT BEING PRECAUTION."
4,"First trip to circus for 3 year old grandson. Barnum and Bailey, among last events when they include elephant act. Kids and parents were thrilled. Easy access to subway. Car, bud traffic and parking may be a problem"
5,"As part of our trip and due to me and my other halfs love of Ice Hockey, we had to squeeze in an NHL game somewhere. The whole day was brilliant from our hotel in Midtown we got the subway down to the Brooklyn Bridge, took a stroll over, taking in the sights. From there we walked into Flatbush and grabbed a bite to eat before we then walked over to the Barclays Centre. The staff were brilliant, helpful and very polite making light conversation as you entered. Once inside we found that there was an array of merchandise, food and drink to be had. After finding our section we were lead down to our seats, which had a fantastic view of the ice. The game itself just complimented the whole experience and getting back to our hotel was so easy as the subway station (Atlantic Avenue) is right outside the main entrance (about 60 yards). Of course it was great that the Islanders won 3-1 but I would highly recommend this to anyone. To the unaware most would probably think of going to Madison Square Garden and taking in a Rangers game. This is in part due to the fact that the Islanders have only just located themselves in the Barclays Centre after moving across from Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in late 2015. But now that this is their home, you have to go and experience it for yourself!"
5,"Many different options .looking forward to events or game or something to do in brooklyn. stop by. be to barclay many time to brooklyn basketball game everysingle time i go brooklyn lose. so good luck .,"
3,We went to see two of the college basketball games and our seats were in section 225. They were very high up there but you could see the game pretty well. We found the concession stand food okay but there were no healthy choices and the condiment stations were not restocked. The hallways were so jammed with people you could hardly get around. Poorly designed. We will not be attend an event there again.
4,First class except for the funneling halls on the second deck.  Seating is comfortable but steep making it hard to get into your row if you have to walk by people.
5,"This was a great venue for the NCAA tournament. It is very well laid out and so new. I like the ushers holding you at the top of the stair for a break in the action. Although those same ushers make it hard to ""trade up"" to better seats that are open too. Best to come by subway train as parking was a little tricky. Numerous close restaurants and a mall to entertain you before or after the game."
4,Went here to watch my son play in the NCAA basketball tournament. We were very impressed by the building and very comfortable seats. The staff were friendly and helpful as well. But parking is almost non existent. Took many folks an hour or more to find parking on the street many blocks away. Uber or public transportation only.
1,Their is a reason the stadium is always empty for Islander games. As if getting their from long island was not hard enough my group was repeatedly harassed by stadium employees.First off the views for hockey are terrible. There are not may good seats in the building but it's the experience that really makes you not want to go. From the second we arrived we were treated like animals. It happened to be bobble head night and after my ticket line ran out of bobble heads I got on another line only to be yelled at for doing so and eventually told get the hell off the line your holding everyone up and was forced to leave the area. Personally I don't care about a little bobble head but the way they treated me for just a simple act of getting in line was disgusting. If that was the only incident I could say ok it was a few bad employees but later in the night it happened again. While sitting in our seats a security person thought she saw someone throw something and dragged my entire row out of the game. This row was not one big group of friends just a random row filled with people that I happen to be in where the security guards said she saw something thrown. Once again they could not be more disrespectful. They dragged the row out of the game for 10 min claiming they had a person on tape throwing something but still needed to take the whole row of people out. After 10 min of being yelled at and being told we all have to leave the property they finally gave in an realized no one had done anything. No one was offered an apology no one was understanding about the situation and in fact when we asked for an apology we were laughed at and told get back to your seats or get removed from the stadium. I understand that security needs to do their job and that some people get crazy at sporting events so they might have been on edge. However the way we were treated was not acceptable. I have never had an experience like this one in any stadium and I don't plan on going back to this one.
5,The staff is one of the best for this event. Go VCU Rams! Can't find a bad seat for basketball. Fourth visit and never been disappointed. Always clean bathrooms and plenty of them!
3,For  a new arena this facility is no better than average. It's one plus are the charging stations around the concourse. Oops second plus is option to use escalators rather than being forced to use the stairs as they do in Madison Square Garden. Ladies restrooms use old  technology for dispensing  paper towels with hand-turn wheels;the steps to higher level seats are very steep;and some of the food service area is very narrow and congested as the concourse narrows. And as you descend from the escalator you enter a very narrow part of the ground floor concourse. Really poor traffic flow and control. I attend Knicks games in the Garden and that renovation  is clearly superior.
5,"Came to watch the Nets v's 76ersBeing from england we didn't really know what to expect but were impressed, security were efficient on entry , food and beverage prices are high but as you would expect to pay at an arena. Food was actually very good. The Americans know how to put on a show, we were entertained from start to finish , the party atmosphere was great.Even though the national anthem wasn't our own hearing it live and seeing the whole arena stand together gives you goose bumps. We were in section 202 and had a great view of the game. The interactive social media meant we got our picture on the big score board twice.Access to and from the arena was so easy from manhattan, one train direct brought us right outside the arena.All in all a thoroughly enjoyable evening."
5,"Whilst on a week's trip to New York, myself and my partner went to the Barclays Centre to see a Brooklyn Nets game and the experience exceeded my expectations. I am not usually interested in basketball but you do not need to be to enjoy this experience. I bought tickets off Ticketmaster and got e-tickets which I immediately printed and brought with us. Entry was fast and stress-free and staff were helpful in assisting us to our seats.The seats were Section 210, Row 1, seats 9 and 10 and the view was fabulous. Highly recommend getting a front row seat and particularly a section to the 'side' of the court.The whole game was very entertaining. It was more than just a sports game. Lots of interval entertainment, music, social media interaction etc. Amazing. Plus you can bring drinks to your seats which is a bonus - I have been to football stadiums before and wasn't allowed to bring drinks back to my seat.Tip - if you are waiting to have dinner in the area, there are lots of nice looking eateries in the Centre. We went to Shake Shack opposite the stadium and it was terrible. Next time we will arrive early and have dinner in the Centre."
2,"This is a very odd stadium both inside and out. Let me start with the outside. Intentionally rusted steel is NOT a good look. The shape of the building is unique/trendy and I like it. But when I saw pictures of the building before the first two rounds on the NCAA tournament, I thought they were all old photo's from the construction of the phase. The rusted panels make it look like scaffolding. The look makes it look like they never finished the outside.Inside: The entrance was very easy to get through. There was a lot of security lines so you didn't have to wait for a long time to get in. The hallways are very dark. Their are lot's of food stands, which is good, but the food choices aren't your typical stadium food. They do have your standard stadium food, then they have no ice cream unless you want it with cake (cheesecake at a basketball game???). How does a stadium in New York city only have pizza at one stand on the main floor? I feel like that should be the food that is in every food stand. The good thing about the main concourse was there was a lot of space.Unlike the first floor, the second level concourse had no space at all, especially if you tried walking past a food stand. The ceiling are also very low that it felt like you were walking in the hallway of a hotel room. Not a great look for a stadium holding 20,000 people.The two good things about the stadium are there are plenty of restrooms and the actual main bowl/court was really good. The upper level seats could use a little more leg room (actually quite surprising how small it was for a new stadium). The seats were very steep, which is very good because it keeps every fan closer to the floor. The inner bowl is the only reason I give this stadium a 2-star review. Parking is pretty close to non-existent and when you are an out-of-towner, taking the subway late at night doesn't feel like a wise life decision."
5,"We were there for NCAA men's basketball, playoffs. The venue was great. Not a bad seat, friendly staff and a clean facility. Well laid out for up scale entertainment."
2,"We attended the 1st and 2nd round sessions for the NCAA Men's Basketball tournament.  Fortunately the games themselves were excellent, but the facility left something to be desired.  We were in an upper section, near midcourt.  The views of the court were fine, but getting in and out of our seats was more than an inconvenience.  There was barely enough room to shuffle your feet to get by people, and we came very close to falling into the row in front of us a couple of times.  I cannot recall any major arena having anything that bad and we've been to dozens of them.  The food areas were overwhelmed and not able to handle the large crowd, which I assume is more than they are accustomed to at NJ Nets games.  In short, we will be attending more March Madness in years to come, but never again at Barclays."
3,Not a great layout for basketball games.  Upper level too removed  from court. Great staff though! Food selections are good.  No alcohol during tournament was disappointing.  Clean bathrooms.
5,"Attended Islanders game. Beautiful arena, not real difficult to get to (subway), nice staff, a building with several restaurants across the street. Appears they are building large hotel a block away."
4,Went to a college basketball double header. price was cheap enough ushers nice. Horribly expensive foodPlace was real clean very convenient by subway
3,"The good: The subway stop is literally at the front door of the place. Couldn't have been easier to get to, even for out-of-towners. The real good: The food was excellent for an arena. Had a rice bowl with chicken that I would have considered pretty good at a restaurant. At an arena it was outstanding.The very bad: The layout is a well-known problem. The obstructed view seating is ridiculous for an arena built in the 21st century. Just unbelievable that hockey wasn't considered in the plan.Overall: A decent place but not nearly on the level of it's better known neighbor over in Manhattan. Seemed just a step below what I would have expected for a major league arena."
3,"Section 225 seems great as it is center court, but the higher you go, the acoustics get worse. We went to see the Knicks play the Nets, and we could not hear a lot of the in between commentary. Make sure to get there early as it takes about 20 minutes to get through security. Barclay's center has a great location.  It is easy to get to and there are plenty of places around the center to grab a drink and some food."
4,"This was I think our fourth trip here for men's basketball. It is sort of a ""Siegel Center North"" (VCU's home arena in Richmond, Va is the Siegel Center). So we really enjoy playing here. The facility is easy to get to as every train seems to go here. It is large, clean, well lit, and has lots of rest rooms and food options. There are also lots of restaurants in the surrounding area. They are a little crazy in not letting you keep water bottle caps or any caps for that matter. So stick one in your pocket if you are a water bottle kind of guy like me."
4,"Every year group of my colleagues and I get together to watch two college basketball games at the Barclay Center. The parking is a little tricky. The lot we usually park in is behind the Arena and it's a little bit of a hike to the entrance. However, once in the arena everything is fine. The sight lines for basketball are very good. The food and drink options are also very good, however, they are a little pricey. All in all, it's a nice arena."
5,Fun and inexpensive.  A lot of kosher food is available. Easy to get there by train or drive. Fun event. The area has gone a real re invention.
5,"Beeing at Barclays, at a Brooklyn Nets game it's like beeing in a party. Orgnaized and clean. Loved the place, loved the game."
4,"Beautiful Arena very hard to get to, absolutely no parking you should take the train. Plenty of stores around the area. Kind of shady in the surrounding area shouldn't wander to far, stay in the immediate area"
4,We had a great time at The Kings Men concert. I hope they bring another one there. We were all singing and clapping together.
4,The venue was very well maintained and easily accessible.  Although our seats were on the top tier we had a clear view. It was our first ever ice hockey match and was a very enjoyable experience. Our only negatives come in beer prices around $13 a can and people coming and going from there seats as they please and this was not managed well by the venue staff.
5,Nets won. If in Brooklyn thus is a must. The Barclays center is an impressive stadium. Would love to attend a concert there.
5,Went to NY Islanders game - subway straight to arena. Well managed entry systems.  noce choice of foods and great match
3,"On the up side this venue is easy to find, very close to the subway. The staff was very helpful and friendly.On the downside it doesn't have the same heart and atmosphere compared to the others I visited in America."
5,"If you get the chance to go see a game or concert at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn you will love it. This is a great venue. We have several opportunities to go and our last was for a Knicks vs, Nets basketball game--it was great. There are plenty of places to eat at the center or the local area has so many choices too."
5,Took my son to see the Nets. Took the subway from Manhattan. Easy to get to. Great security. Fun atmosphere. We will go again when we are in town.
5,came here for a Knicks v Nets basketball game. loved the layout of the stadium where as soon as you were through security you could see the court. staff were friendly enough and it was close to the subway.really enjoyed it :)
2,"Having been to many arenas throughout the NHL and minor leagues of hockey, I do have a decent background when comparing venues. This was my first visit to the Barclay's center, and I have to say I was let down. We sat in the upper level on the side which was is normally a good spot at any game. Everyone I had spoken to who had been to the arena told me that upper deck seating was the better choice for this venue. I poked around a little bit in the lower level and could see why the lower level was a less than stellar option. When I arrived at my seat in the upper level, I found it was difficult to maneuver around those already in their seats, stepping over their feet and avoiding the cup holders at floor level is a real hazard. Seeing the game was difficult, seemed as though I spent more time looking around heads than I did seeing the play of the game. I feel bad for anyone under 6' 0"" as I can imagine they'd be losing out on a lot more of the game than I did. The overall feel of the place was strange, it's so obvious hockey wasn't in anyone's mind when the place was built. The lack of seats on the one end and the void spaces where seats should have been no matter the sport takes away from those who would want to sit in those areas. It's an experiment that's on the way to failure in my opinion. May be a good place for basketball or a concert, but hockey just doesn't fit."
5,My fiancee and I went to see the Nets and the Islanders on back to back nights and loved every second. If you shop around you can get tickets really cheap which is a bonus. We took the Q from Manhattan and it drops you off at the door to the Barclays Center! The arena is really well laid out and getting in and out is very easy. We had seats in the top tier for both the Basketball and the Hockey and the view was fantastic. They really do put on a show. Happy to say i will be both a Nets and Islanders fan for life!
5,"I've gone to the barclays center more than I've been to Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden, Met Life Stadium, and Citifield, they have always treated my guess and I with respect. The all access tickets for food and drinks don't hurt either lol.Allymisslove and the love squad, is the best, I'm just waiting to get one of those t-shirts thrown my way, lol...."
5,"My wife and I attended the Islanders v Kings game on Thursday 11th  February at the center. the venue itself is very impressive from the outside and inside as well, its fairly new, used by the Brooklyn Nets since 2012 and in its first season with the New York islanders. I am a Washington Capitals fan but took the opportunity whilst in New York to catch a game. We sat in section 225 row 18 which cost us $35 a ticket, whilst it seemed far back the view we had of the game was actually really good and therefore the seats were great value for money. There was a lot of empty seats, maybe due to the team leaving the Nassau Coliseum but some fairly vocal support to my left from fans who presumably attend regularly which reminded me of attending football games back home.There is a massive choice of food or drink inside after passing through some minor security at the entrance, there are also several merchandise stands which means you can get what you want with only some minor queueing.We took part in the Valentines puck surprise as well which was $25 dollars a puck, if your puck wasn't signed by a player then you got to meet the players whose number was on the puck.My wife managed to pick me a puck that hadn't be signed and the number was 41 (Jaroslav Halak- ex Washington capitals goal tender) so I was told to go back to the stand where we purchased it 5 mins before the end of the third period and we would then go to meet the players, unfortunately due to security reasons my wife had to wait for me on the main concourse as I went down towards ice level and my player didn't show (I ended up meeting and getting the puck signed by Mikhail Grabovski- also ex capitals) but during my time waiting for the players security had closed the venue and asked that my wife leave, even after she explained the situation to them, they told her no one was left in the building but cleaners and security which obviously worried her and when I eventually came out she was quite distraught as she was alone in a strange city.This was the only bad point of the whole evening as the venue and the game itself (5-2 to the islanders) was awesome."
3,I have been twice this season. If you drive parking in the shopping center across the street is $36 but I haven't found anywhere else that may be cheaper. Once inside its very dark and somewhat gloomy. There are plenty of bathrooms but the concession stands are few and very slow lines (even during the game).
5,"It's the 3rd time I visited this center. I really enjoy its layout, how spacious the seats are,  the acoustics and lights. It has also numerous vendors for coffee, cocktails &amp; food. It even has a ""meditation' room and a wheelchair accessible area.I think the best part too is having the subway line just outside which makes it very accessible from all points, not only in NYC but counties in the north &amp; even from NJ.It is also the home for the Nets basketball team but they have great shows (i.e. Bocelli, Il Volo, etc)."
5,"Fabulous to experience a basketball match. Seats that are high up are quite a steep incline, so try and get seats on a lower level."
1,"1st I must say, I'm from Staten Island &amp; wanted this place to work out...I attended my 2nd game here &amp; my opinion hasn't changed. PS- I had 1 year season tix the second year they won the cup. Yes the building looks great from the outside, plenty of transportation ways on getting to the game. the backup due to nowadays security I understand, but there's room for more to make the lines faster. The hallways are dark &amp; narrow. Consessions on rolling carts? Electrical cords all over? Panels falling off the walls? How old is this place? Lines everywhere? No/limited TV's in the hallways, off center scoreboard, limited view seats...Bring them back to the old site &amp; build a place FOR HOCKEY!"
5,"I have to admit I was a little worried about watching my first Islanders' home game away from NVMC. But Barclays Center is a first class facility. From the guest services to food selection to restroom facilities, this place is top notch. There are noted ""limited view"" seats in the place. They are clearly advertised. Don't sit there. I sat in section 16 and loved every minute of it. It helped that the Isles were 5-2 winners against the Kings."
4,"I think the Barclays Center is a must better arena than MSG. It is better price than MSG, better seat options, and better pricing. I would advise on not selecting the highest seats. The climb up there is long and you feel like you are on a slight tilt. I have seen Jay Z here, basketball games, Disney on Ice, so the venue can handle all types of events. A great addition to Brooklyn!"
4,"Concert was Awesome! Well worth the trip and tickets, concert was great. We didn't leave Barclay's until 12midnight. Barclays Center was nice organized and clean. They got everyone in through security and helped concert goers with questions regarding seats. The restaurants are costly though. Make sure you eat before you go."
5,"Very impressed with the Barclays Center, we had seats in section 204 to see the NY Islanders v Detroit Red Wings and couldn't fault the experience. Great range of options in the food court and staff very helpful throughout the venue."
5,"I came to town for a R&amp;B singer Maxwell and rapper Nas concert on Valentines night. It was record temperatures and I was not in the mood to spend any time outside.  The first thing I noticed about the Barclays was how it looked like it was built on a side walk.  However, the arena looks very impressive from the outside.  The car service immediately told me I would have to be dropped off across the street in front of the arena. I was not happy but found an easy walk to the front glass doors. Inside the Barclays looks just as impressive outside as it does on the inside.  After a steep walk down the stairs to my floor seats, the seating inside the arena is very intimate.  Ladies this is not the place to wear your high heels especially if you are sitting on the floor.  After the concert, catching a cab was a big headache. I was told to go to the cab stand but no cabs could be found. I waited well over an hour for a cab. My suggestions is to call ahead for one before you leave the arena. Other than freezing my fingers off, I had a great time."
4,"Watched a boxing match here. Great view, plenty of food outlets but quite expensive. Difficult to obtain tickets if you live outside the US. We had a friend in Brooklyn who could get tickets for us."
5,"It was out first time here last night. This is a beautiful arena with lots of food and drink options. We sat in section 225, but still had an excellent view of the game being that far up. There is a subway station right next to the arena making it easy to access. It is in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, which offers lots of great restaurants in a close proximity. I would go back again."
4,Home of the Brooklyn Nets and Islanders and every other thing you can think of. Cool new stadium w good seating and decent prices. Beers are pricy but where isn't it. Easy access via trains like the G. Fun environment and atmosphere.
3,Everyone in Brooklyn complained about it clogging up the roads and putting those with small operations nearby out of business one way or another.  Yes and they were all correct.  Big is not better.
4,"Nets won so that was great. Modern stadium. So easy to get there via subway, getting in wasn't difficult. Loads of choice of food. Sat row 13 and the views great. It wasn't a sell out game so the atmosphere was lacking slightly!"
4,We went to a NCAA basketball tournament at the Barclay Center in December. Coming from out of town I was worried that it would be difficult to get to and get out of but there was no need to worry. There is a subway stop right outside of the center. Area was nice as well and the arena is beautiful. We will definitely be back again for a game in the future.
5,"friendly staff, easy going inside, enough salespoints for food, drinks, goodies. Good views from every corner"
5,"We went to watch the New York Islanders Ice Hockey whilst visiting from the UK and loved the venue, some great reviews on here regarding seating and we had some cracking seats. Good Subway links from NYC right to the door, was welcomed into an Italian restaurant for pre game beers just across from the arena which was nice. Only negative was the price of beers, wow, $13 dollars for a can of lager!!!! : ( Still didn't stop me having 4 though, loads of food options to help soak the beers up too!"
5,"Travelled to The Barclays Center on a visit from DublinWent for the Harlem Globetrotters event on Jan 2ndGreat venue, great staff, great foodSubway access, very cleanMuch much better than any arena in Ireland"
5,Busy area.. great shopping mall across the treet.  Fun to go to concerts at Barclays and very easy to get to.. see what kind of discount tickets you can get!!!
5,"As one enters thd Barclay Center there is a hush of expectancy.  You expect a great basketball game, a wonderful concert by Streisand, Springsteen or the like, you expect an exciting ice hockey game.  You will never be disappointed."
5,"I've done a couple of Nets games and an Islanders game, and Barclay's has MSG beat in my mind for 2 main reasons:1. Ease of travel: living in Brooklyn, its 15 minutes home from a game, vs 1 hr and a transfer from MSG2. Every seat offers a great view: even nosebleed section or behind the goalie at the rafters, you feel like its right there.  Go.  Enjoy a game!!"
4,"Awesome sports arena. Watched 2 basketball matches, one vs the Raptures and the other against Orlando. Very easy to get to via Manhattan, one tube line. Good atmosphere during the match. The only thing that slightly ruins it for me is the price of food and drinks. Paid $6 for a small coke, and $6 for a slice of pizza. Seems pretty expensive if going on a regular basis."
5,"I will start with the one negative... the signage coming out of the train station was poor. Although there are two exits to the stadium (one right outside) to tourists like me who come out the wrong exit, i literally felt like I was in the middle of nowhere so perhaps something that needs improving. We had a fantastic time watching the basketball Vs the raptors. The arena is so high tech and visually pleasing. The security were polite and helpful when entering the stadium. The food outlets were varied and fairly well priced. We opted for hotdogs which were lovely. Our seats were the second cheapest available, were high up but the view was outstanding and better than I had expected!! the leg room was fine and im over 6 foot which was pleasing. The staff on exit were helpful and the subway quick and efficient."
5,My family went here to see a NY Islanders Hockey game. This a nice place to see a hockey game. Everything was top notch!
5,It is not as nice as MSG but it's good.  It's bigger than you think and can be a little confusing.  Good enough food options but it could be better.
4,Thebarclay is easy to get to whether by train cab uber or bus Not as many food Coourt areas as MSGSECURITY INDIDE COULd HAVE BEEN BETTER   NYC cops seem to defer to I house staff who were hard pressed with the mini scuffles among fans who had a little too much.  It's boxing I guessAs a sports venue it is very good. Great sound video and views. Would go again.
4,"Great place for hockey with great seats in Section 26 by the blue line! Isles tied it in regulation with 1 minute to spare, but lost in the shootout against Vancouver."
5,"I paid my first visit to the Barclays Center to see the Islanders play the Canucks. I was not sure what to expect because I have heard some many negative things about Barclays from Islander fans. I must disagree. I think the venue is excellent for hockey, and the few quirks in the building (e.g., the slightly off center scoreboard) add to its charm. The corridors are much more spacious than the NMC and the concessions better."
5,"So easy and convenient to see a concert at the Barclays center.  We have taken the train and also driven in without any issues.The staff are so polite and seem very happy to greet you to the Barclays.  We've seen everyone from Pink to Neil Diamond to the Who, to Italian singer Eros Ramazzotti and will be seeing Il Volo next month and Eros again in October.If you get there early and have some time to kill, there are plenty of eating options nearby and shopping to keep you busy."
5,"Whether you root for the nets or islanders, the Barclay center in downtown Brooklyn is the place to watch a game. Comfortable seats, severely clean, modern bathrooms, great food, and easy access via the subway or Long Island railroad"
4,"Whilst visiting from England, we booked tickets to see the Brooklyn Nets vs Washington Wizards, We found the Barclays center easily from the nearby tube station and upon entering the park, found the whole experience great. The only negative was we found the food and drinks to be pretty expensive here."
2,Level it and move it somewhere else.  The poorer landowners are increasingly getting the boot and property that was a couple of grand in now in the millions.   Utter trash.
5,"There is nothing like taking public transportation to a show, getting out of the train and being right on the doorstep of the venue!  Every seat in this venue is a good seat.  Nice iconic Brooklyn eats!"
5,Saw Neil Diamond. Sound was awesome. Easy to get to by subway. Staff was very friendly until I took my phone out to take a picture. The usher was quite nasty.
4,Saw an Nhl game here. Easy access from NYC. Good seats. Great atmosphere. Sadly overpriced food. Made us throw out 2 snack sized Pringles and water so we could pay $6.50 for a new water and $6.00 for a mini popcorn
5,"Saw 2 NBA games here in December and have visited before and I'm never disappointed. Easy to get to with a metro line right outside the entrance, plenty of space to move around in once inside and plenty of food stores/toilets. The seats are really comfortable, and whenever I've been I've had a great view of the court. Will go again for sure"
4,"Really enjoyed a basket ball game here. Grandstand is very VERY steep and you may experience dizziness climbing to top sections. But it's clean, great staff, efficient security checks. Experience food and drink, but that's to be expected."
5,Great for basketball games and concerts. Have been to a few events here and they have all been top notch. The food is also very good here.
4,Good Place for shopping. Best Buy is near buy. One can spend a very leisure time and have a fun and subway access is very much there
4,"I visited for the Nets vs Wizards game on Boxing Day. Absolutely fantastic atmosphere and game, a highlight of our trip. Only complaint is food and drink is pricey. But really fantastic to go and watch the NBA and the tickets are reasonable if booked in advance.Enjoy!"
5,What a great asset to Brooklyn. We have seen both a NBA game and a concert here. Easy access and exit points along with comfortable seats.
5,Good security yet friendly. We first ate in the self-serve dining room ~ surprising good food with a casual dining menu. We attended a concern so our box was a bit further from of the stage than orchestra seats  ~ would have been perfect for a game. The service was friendly ~ and they moved people in and out quickly. Centrally located easy to get to by taxi or public transportation.
5,"My husband and I had a great experience.  Once you stepped into the VIP entrance,you could see the attention to detail. The food in Calvin Klein section was pretty good, especially the cheeseburger sliders. The shrimp ice sculpture with the Nets/Timberwolves was a nice tough along with the snacks to go.  The cheesecake from the arena was one of the best we have had.The seats in the arena were comfortable, entertainment was good and the staff had great customer service."
5,"Great seats! Very nice facility, food and drinks are over priced. Overall, great experience! Our son loved the live event!"
4,"I was lucky enough to come upon 200 level seating tickets. I could not believe how close to the action I was. I walked around and seemed that the views from upper level seating was very satisfactory. Had a good time here, and it was a great experience.Good:-Employees were able to give easy simple directions to follow at the security checkpoint-Barclays is EASILY accessible via LIRR, 2,3,4,5,B and Q subway lines-The views from the upper levels are obviously farther away but the sight lines are great-I did not eat, but there were a lot of food choices on the different levelsBad:-None"
3,"Everything you could possibly want is in this building. Charging station, Juniors cheese cakes, Mexican food, pizza, candy store, you name it they got it, BUT definitely not made for an NHL hockey team. Everything is offset and doesn't feel right. Seats are not that comfy and forget leg room.  They tried to squeeze as many seats as possible without thinking about the room people need to sit there for a three hour event."
3,"I visited Barclay Center for a preseason Islanders vs Devils game and was very disappointed.  Overall, the venue was nice, but the sight lines were awful for hockey! Every time someone stood up, the view was blocked.  Long lines at the concessions and crowded corridors.  I'll be back in April for a concert and will see if my point of view changes."
4,"This was our first visit here.  We were first in line to enter for the New Year's Eve concert of Jimmy Buffett.  Security was very big with NYPD on site this night.  We got through quick, helped by our clear NASCAR backpack which all security people love.  I almost never buy alcohol at shows but $14.75 for one margarita?  Staff seemed friendly throughout the experience.  They showed us the way to our seats, which were up narrow stairs to incredibly steep seats in Section 207.  There were cup holders basically in front of you on the floor.  Older drunk idiots (2-4 couples) caused my family of 4 to get up repeatedly like every 10 minutes for 3 hours.  You have to pick-up any drinks from cup holders you don't want kicked.  Prepare to be stepped on and with no apologies.  I fell into the people next to me just to get to the 3rd seat of the row trying not to fall down over the row in front- it is horrifying.  There can't be any security once you are seated as the person in front of us was sneaking an e-cigarette of some kind every few minutes and the guy a couple seats over was smoking marijuana cigarettes constantly throughout the show.  I didn't know at the time that it was not cigarettes.  Either way, they were breaking the law, as well as upsetting my 5 year old's son breathing.  The seats, when you do get up, force your jacket to slide through to the floor and then you have to pull it up before sitting down or it gets stuck every time.  My back was killing me from the seats and my wife was squeezed a bit from the width.  Not sure how different these are compared to Met Life, IZOD, Prudential or MSG where we have also been in the last 2 years with no issues.  The subway is super convenient but it costs more and takes longer to get here vs MSG.  All in all, we did have a great time at the show and NYPD did an excellent job too.  I would never return to sit in the upper deck seating, although we got out very easily."
5,"This was my first time at this venue and I was very pleased, staff was helpful and friendly. All the food and beverages were great. I really liked the layout and the feel of the arena"
2,"While very nice once seated and convenient to public transportation, getting into the facility is chaotic and poorly organized. Food is good but incredibly slow service. Aisle attendants are more focused on policing access to seats as opposed to assisting people to their seats. Once seated, it's excellent entertainment, even though Nets aren't particularly good. But overall, I would not recommend."
5,We came here to watch a Brooklyn Nets game as my boyfriend is a big Basketball fan. It was great I would really recommend it we had really good seats and the atmosphere was great and they won which was even better.
4,"Being a newer venue, the Barclay Center has a better sound system that Madison Square Garden.  While it may not be the best place to see a game, it is a very, very good Concert Arena."
5,"Great venue for sports or entertainments.  Easy access, lots of vendors, great design. The outside is not an engineering marvel, do not understand the rusty design, but very nice (since it is relatively new) inside."
4,Barclays’s Center is a very nice venue.  I traveled on the Q train from Central Park to Atlantic Ave and it was a quick 20 minute ride with no subway change.  Walking out of the subway you are less than 60 yards from the front door.  I was there for a pair of basketball games and the line formed early and wrapped around the building on both front sides.  Although we did find that there are doors on the backside of the building that are less busy due to most people coming through the subway.  Was very pleased with the arena.  It has nice wide seats with padded backs and seats. As well as cup holders.  The seats in the 100 level seemed to be a little short on leg room.  View from around the arena seemed good from most all locations except behind the goals. The sound system was great even with all the fan noise you could still hear the announcer very clearly.  There is definitely a better food selection on the main level than the second floor.  Don't expect to get 32 oz sodas even though you will pay the 32 oz price the largest will be a 20 oz bottle.  Restrooms are surprisingly not very plentiful or spacious.
4,Went for a college doubleheader and loved it. Wasn't a bad seat in the house only negative was not all the food options were available. ..lots of $10+ beers and snacks but nothing of substance except hot dogs:(
5,"We go to basketball games in nearly every city we visit, and this is by far the slickest arena we've been in. Every aesthetic decision was thoughtful and well executed; from the lighting, to the color schemes, the floor plan, the dance troupe, the production: it all worked in tandem to create a memorable experience."
4,"The people here are warm, friendly and make you enjoy your visit.  We recently went to a Nets game and each and every person we dealt with added to the experience of our visit. However, getting here is tough and on their web cite they advertise for a business called Click and Park.  They took our reservation  and our money and the day  before cancelled because they DISCOVERED that the lot was not taking reservation in December and we would get a refund in five to seven business days.  It is now December 26, they have our money since the middle of  November and today for the third time (email and two phone calls) we heard again that it will be five to seven days.  Barclay advertises this company but disavows any knowledge of them. I would recommend a visit to Barclay center but a void Click and Park even though it looks like it is connected to the center."
1,Absolutely a crap experience. Was so excited to go to a Nba game as we are visiting from Australia. Firstly the ground staff are so rude and whilst lining up kept screaming at people to walk around the other side of the venue because we would be waiting 15 minutes to get it and there were no lines around the other side. The time it would have taken to walk around the other side we would've been in. She was so angry that no one listened. The wait was only about 5 minutes anyway. We went to the Brooklyn net store inside which was absolute chaos and over priced. So we decided to go back outside and walk across the road to modells which stuff was half the price. Trying to find an exit the staff informed us if we left we wouldn't be allowed back in and all exits are final. Umm sorry what? What do you mean you can't re enter? Every single stadium around the world that I've been to have a pass out system. The staff told us that the reason this is is because we could walk out and bring a gun back in. This makes no sense as we would walk back through security? The seating is so cramped and steep and the cup holders at your feet are just there to trip you. In fact the man six seats down from us was taking a photo for a couple rows in front and fell 4 rows down tumbling seat over seat due to the steepness. He was ok.. I think. All in all the stadium is quite nice. Ample food opportunities and toilets clean. It's a real shame the seating is so crap and the weird exit rules apply.
5,"We watched a Brooklyn Nets basket ball match there over the weekend end and was blown away by the brilliant design of this sporting arena.  It is huge and well thought out.Every seat appears to have a great view, although you would not want to suffer from vertigo.The acoustics are clear so you will not have to worry about missing any of the commentary.The staff are very friendly and helpful.  It is easily accessed by the subway which is right outside the front entrance.A truly magnificent design which sets the standard for all other sporting complexes."
3,"The Barclays Center looks amazing from the outside. From the inside, though, it's just like any other arena. It might as well be Madison Square Garden."
4,We went to a fight here and found the place to be clean and our seats were great.  We enjoyed the venue.
5,"For the few years in which we got that arena , we had lots of big name  artists like  Barbara Straighten, Justin Timberlake   , lady Gaga,and Bruce Springstene performed there.It is the home for the Brooklyn nets and the New York Islanders. There are  top boxing match held there also.It is a huge and very beautiful building.The building  can be seen from afar. Coming out from the 2, 3 , 4, 5 r,q,n,b and,d train in Atlantic Ave; that area of the subway opens up to the lovely stadium. Maybe it is the best view  one can get of the stadium."
5,Great place in the heart of downtown Brooklyn to attend an event. It's new and clean. Great unobstructed seats for events.
5,"Am a Brooklyn resident and a fan of the NY Islanders and went out to the Nassau Coliseum for games.  Even though it was a dump, it had a certain old time feel that is lacking at the Barclays Center.  There was not a bad seat in the house and the tickets were generally  inexpensive.  However, the Barclays Center is clean and new and has more than adequate amounts of stalls and toilet paper in the bathrooms.   I think they need to work out some of the kinks in a place that was not originally built for NHL Hockey, but so far it has been most pleasant.  Unlike the Nassau Coliseum, all of the seats are in good condition and do not cause backaches.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  Even though the seats cost more I am able to use the NYC subway system and save on parking fees and wear and tear on the car. All in all, I am an Islanders fan and think that the move was good for them so I will continue going to games there, until I move from New York."
4,"The staff is so friendly and the food, merchandise choices are great! Conveniently located-the subway is across the street and there are plenty of cabs.The signage outside is awful though. You can clearly go the box office and will call but there's no signs if you have a ticket already. The door jockeys had to call out to the crowd. To get out (exit) was challenging as well."
4,"Have had season tickets for the Nets since Barclays Center opened. It is a nice venue for basketball. If you're in the lower bowl the seats have excellent sight lines, if you're sitting between the baselines it is a fair bet your ticket includes free food. The ushers were all trained by the Disney staff and are unfailingly nice. The place is clean.. All pretty good. The upper bowl is really really steep - nerve wrackingly so. The arena doesn't get LOUD like a lot of basketball arenas so that is a drawback - keeps the energy low - maybe that is just the Nets and their atrocious basketball? The food, which was incredible when they opened, has reverted to the mean. Tastes more like regular arena food now - much less variety - suspect this is a by-product of so much of the food being comped for high end seats. I've seen a number of concerts here; the Stones, Jay Z, Justin Timberlake. We've sat up high and on the floor. The acoustics for music are really good. Again the ushers and security and so nice. The arena also has a very nice smell. It is the same no matter what the attraction. Hockey. yIkes! How did they not build this brand new arena to fit a hockey rink? There are obstructed view seats where the obstruction is not being able to see the goal. Just a disaster."
5,"I recently watched the Nets v the Clippers during a trip to New York.  It is a fantastic arena, very clean and lots of choices in terms of food and drink.  A great first time NBA experience!"
1,"I find it hard to believe that security would do such a thing to innocent, harmless fans minding their own business. Islanders fans are sick of the Barclays Center rules. They have gone too far. It's bad publicity on the CEO of Barclays Center. Maybe he will finally get the picture. It's become evident that his staff doesn't know hockey culture and are unprofessional. The video is extremely disturbing and the story that started the fight is even sadder. To the Barclays Center Staff, THINK before overreacting."
4,"Went to the Islanders-Panthers game December 16.  Section 207, Row 17.  The good:1 - Ease of travel to/from arena.  Plenty of subway options.2 - Food options aplenty.3 - Clean bathrooms.4 - Easier to move around the arena as compared to the Nassau Coliseum.The not so good:1 - To get a full view of the rink, I sat in the upper bowl, and you are much farther away from the action than at the Coliseum. The seats were high. Oxygen tank high.  However, I could see the whole rink.  Can't speak for the partial view seats, but I can understand why there aren't many sell outs.2-  Not a lot of leg room at the seats.3 - Acoustics were so so - difficult to hear the PA announcer and official's whistles.4-  The Nathan's hot dog stand did not sell Nathan's fries, but the Burger stand did.  Don't understand that.After hearing the horror stories of the seating, it wasn't as bad as I thought, but I would check out the virtual seating chart before buying tickets to make sure the view of the rink isn't blocked."
5,I downloaded the Barclays Center app was very useful to plan our trip to watch Joseph Prince at the Barclays Center. I couldn't get the seats that I wanted so I had to settle for seats that were pretty high up but I was surprised to see when I got there that actually I had a very good view of the stage plus the big Jumbotrons TVs  were nice. The seats were very comfortable and Clean and the building seemed relatively new. All in all I would go back to watch an event there it was very nice.
4,"Went to see an Islanders game when on holiday in NY with my brother. As we'd been out in the city I had my camera and lenses with me. When we got to security, I was told that I'd have to have over my gear. We'd bought the tickets online, and there was no mention of this. I wasn't keen on this as its worth a lot. However, that said, the staff were incredibly helpful and polite and assured me it would be fine, and gave me a token to collect afterwards."
5,"Well equipped, modern arena. Were here for a Brooklyn Nets game. Entry was smooth in spite of the large crowds. Seats are comfortable, although a little cramped perhaps in the upper sections. View of the field is perfect, helped by the large screens hanging over the the center of the room."
4,"We had booked place in a suite on level B for this match, and had expectations to this experience. We ordered some food sand ""bottomless"" popcorn, both were disappointing. The ""burgers"" were very small, and the bottomless popcorn was not refilled, even after our requests. The staff seeemed to have little knowledge about the arena as such, and were of no help when we asked for directions to other attractions.The arena is new for the Islanders, hopefully the atmosphere will be better after som time.Nice and clean arena though."
4,Always have had a great time either at a concert or hockey game. Seating is AWESOME and the arena is very clean and new. The staff are all very helpful and courteous and nice. The food and bars are cool and the way the are set up there are no dead areas. You can get a hot dog and beer anywhere and the restrooms are close to all seating. What I like the most is that once your in it is very easy to get to any seat in the house. Recommend.
4,"We have seen a few Nets games and have been very happy with the new place. Our seats were a bit high but the view is really good. The food, while expensive is good! The seats could be a bit wider but I guess they are trying to fit in as many as possible. The location is just right if you are taking the subway or railroad. Don't even think of driving here because the traffic is horrendous and forget about finding a parking spot. Give it a shot and see what you think. It's another attraction in beautiful Brooklyn!"
5,"This stadium is great.  It is amazing how much it looks like a theatre....with the ""field"" area being lit up....It doesn't matter if it is a sporting event or concert It seems like you are on the floor, with a clear view of everything from practically anywhere you sit. I had great seats at a Nets game and I have had nose bleed seats at Jay-Z.... Always a great time with a great view.  The best part about it is that it is super easy to get to by subway and there are a ton of bars &amp; restaurants close by, if you want to hang in Brooklyn for a bit!"
4,"We watched the Bulls beat the Nets here in October. It is very easy to get to with the subway directly outside the stadium. Very straightforward and quick to get into the venue, there are also lots of food and drink stalls. Our view was half way up in a corner and was great. The atmosphere was a little lacking, possibly as the Nets were never in front!"
4,"Recently attended an event at the arena. The arena is smaller that I imagined, but the staff was efficient and pleasant. Would definitely attend another event at this arena. In addition, the Barclays Center is easily accessible by public transportation."
5,"First time at the Barclays Center. We went for the NIT basketball tournament. Very, very nice arena."
5,I've been here for two concerts and had a great time. Very easy to get there using mass transit. It was very easy to ge a cab after the event as well. Staff seemed friendly and there were several places to get drinks and snacks.
4,This arena looks like a ship from Star Wars from the outside but is really nice and new inside. The Nets court is really cool. Don't buy food in the Arena; it's ridiculously expensive! They only have one size of drink and don't show you that it's a 12 oz cup until it's too late. $6. what a joke.
4,"I came here the other night for an Islanders game with my friends. This stadium is great! Very updated, lots of food choices, lots of bathrooms (so key!), and generally everything is so shiny and new. Everything is overpriced, but that's pretty standard for stadiums so I'm not really sure what people are complaining about. That's pretty par for the course. The subway goes right here, as well as the railroad. It's pretty convenient. As for people complaining about the railroad times not lining up exactly with the time of the event they went to, is that a serious complaint? I mean really? The world does not revolve around you and your event. The train times are set the way they are set. And I feel like this goes without saying (but apparently not because people complained about this as well), there is very little parking around. It is NYC, that is true ANYWHERE you go in NYC. Don't bother driving. I look forward to seeing other events at this stadium."
4,"This was our first NBA game live and really enjoyed it. The entertainment between timeouts,quarters and halftime were alot of fun to experience. Tickets for the games start at $usd59...we went with these tickets and although they were very high up - we had great views.  Purchased a  beer and 1 sprite for $17 so not cheap. Did not buy food but there were plenty of choices. There is a ShakeShack across the road for those wanting a more family friendly  (price wise ) option.   The Subway at the end of the night was not as crazy as expected."
4,"I enjoyed my visit to the Barclays Center to see a New York Islanders game.  It was easy to get their by subway from Manhattan.  The arena is nice; however, caution about some limited view seats at one of the nets.  I got some excellent seats on the secondary market and witnessed a great game."
4,My husband and I went to Barclay Center to see Pat Benetar and the WHO in concert! We had a great time except that they were smoking in the audiance and the vendor prices were high!
1,While the outside of the arena is quite striking the interior leaves a lot to be desired especially considering it is such a new arena. The concourses are closed in and everything in the arena incuding the seats is dark greys an black. It may work for basketball but as a hockey arena this is a joke. Most of the seats in one enzone are obstructed view seats and all of the team stores are still called Nets stores. The Islanders are the poor cousin in this relationship and should be embarrassed that this was the best option for them. Anyone who thinks this is nicer than Madison Square Garden is either employed by the Nets or doesn't get out much. Seriously!
3,"I drove by and wanted to just see the interior, no can do.  The exterior is ok, but maybe because of security I could not go inside."
4,"I've got to say this venue was one of the easiest ones to get away from after a sporting event. The location of the subway is so close and with frequent trains   There was no crowding. I was here for a ny islanders game, one end of the rink was so pretty bad limited view seating. I think in modern stadiums/ arenas this isn't acceptable. But other than that I think the staff and the look of the arena was very good"
3,"Went to the islanders v coyotes game to check out the new isles home. Be careful where you sit! The 200 blocks are very steep and little room to manoeuvre past people in the row. One ""nice"" lady couldn't be bothered to move her legs to let us pass - too busy eating - a my husband fell down two rows. Not that she cared , sadly nor did any arena staff who did not come to either help of check if we needed assistance - serious training needed here. The local fans do not adhere to the no movement during play ""rule"" so your view is often blocked. Not sure I would go again unless in lower blocks - not so steep"
2,"I had tickets for Marc Anthony's Concert in early October, 2015.We traveled from  Boston, it took us close to 2 hours to drive from Manhattan to Brooklyn. It was very difficult to find parking. Barclays has very few parking options close to the Arena. The Arena itself was just adequate, nothing special.The vendors had very limited options.We will probably go to concerts being held at the Garden in Boston and Mohegan Sun's Arena. These are superior venues."
4,"Easy to find. Buy event tickets at the door. Well organised, slick operation. We saw the islanders ice hockey and returned to watch the Nets basketball. Good seats with great views and very entertaining. I can't sayvwhich I prefer. The only downside is $11 for a beer."
4,Saw Carlos Vives and Marc Anthony. They were great! What a treat. Sound and visuals were great too.  And lets not forget the hotdogs...Nathan's Yummmm.
3,Very convenient location to public transportation. The food options are great. Seats are comfortable. My seats were in section 210. View of ice is great when empty. As soon as people seated it's a little tough to see without sitting on edge of seat. Only major complaint is the log jam entering and re entering the section. Every single person has to show ticket as proof they belong in section. I had to do so......FIVE separate occasions before the game even started. Missed some early action because of it. Seems like complete overkill for an upper level section that once in the section I could move freely across sections. What's the point? Incredibly annoying.
5,"My family and I went to watch Brookline Nets basketball. We all had a great time, with my 17 year old daughter saying this was the best thing she did in New York. Easy to get to on the subway. First game we have been to, and hope to go to a game again."
5,Another arena that did it right. It'll have everything thing you'll need to enjoy your game. Food is different at every concession. And it's Brooklyn. It's the best :)
5,"I was just at the Barclays Center on Tuesday night for the TidalX Concert and I had an amazing time. I saw Nick Jonas, Indochine, Usher, Nas, Lil Wayne, French Montana, Thomas Rhett, Nicki Minaj, and of course JayZ and Beyonce'. There are plenty of restaurants and drink kiosks there. There are plenty of security officers, as well as NYPD. It is safe. The area has parking and plenty of taxis around and near public transportation. I love the arena and want to attend a Nets game next!"
1,"I went to a Friday night Islanders-Bruins game and after all was said and done, we will not likely return, even if the tickets were free.The railroad commute was short of 1 hour as expected. We barely caught the puck drop. The earlier train would have been too early and only arrived 10 minutes sooner. I specifically purchased FULL view seats (Sec 222) on the blue line where the NYI shoot twice, however, the depth of the arena makes it so that even if people a few rows in front of you stand up, your view is blocked. Getting in and out of the seats causes quite a disruption and it's tight. The jumbo tron is essentially a huge TV that you need to see what the heck just happened because the people in front are standing or getting in or out of their seats. Ridiculous! Beers are around $11 each and quite frankly, the food stands are no better than anywhere else. The better food must be on a different level. The lines are full of people waiting just like the Coliseum was. The cotton candy was two mushed up balls of cotton stuffed in a bag which looked like they were leftovers, shouldn't cotton candy be airy and fluffy? The men's bathroom was out of order by the end of the game (really?) and so my sons had to walk around to the next one probably a third of the way around the arena. Repeat train ride on the way home making every local stop known to man which had us arriving back home before midnight. In short, a 6 hour affair from the time we departed. Kids were asleep on the train, heck I was asleep too. Last year I had vouched never to go to Brooklyn to see the Isles but this was a birthday surprise for my sons, plus I wanted to see for myself. Total cost for this experience - $58x7 tickets ($406), $99 train tickets, beer and over-breaded, over-fried chicken strips with fries, $110. You must be kidding. That does not seem like a sound long term plan for the NY Islanders. By all means, try it out yourself and let's see how many more empty seats remain after one full season. What a shame."
1,"Place is not suitable for hockey.  Lots of blind spots. Can't see the corners of the ice.  Why would i pay $180 a ticket, and only see 7/8 the rink? Employees rude. Won't be returning ever again."
4,"Good for Nets or a concert, staff try to be friendly, good assortment of eats and plethora of great options within a few blocks.  Sooooo much nicer than MSG."
3,Were there for the first Islanders game.     Jumbotron is off center and the sound system and views are obstructed.   You can tell it is a basketball arena converted to ice hockey.   Food options good but found passageways narrow.    Stairs are at the corner of the building and not too many escalators to the nose bleed seats.
5,I have been to the Barclays a few times for boxing events etc.  I enjoyed the arena and the box seats where great.  The good at the suites was good and so was the desserts.  Should visit at least once.  You will enjoy
5,"Good sound acoustics.  Seating is ok. Employees courteous and helpful Parking is difficult.  I urge anyone once you get tickets for your event, reserve parking Because they sell out quickUse Parking Whiz app and reserve a parking space at one of a few parking garage.    There is one close to venue then there is one few blocks away ( 4). On Vanderbilt Ave off Atlantic Ave. Excel parking.  Cost is about $20.00 but you can find an online coupon code and it costs about $18.00You will not find street parking.."
4,Great arena for s show.  Easily accessible by mass transit.  Took in a show and was pleasantly surprised.  Lots of places to eat around venue and to enjoy the sights.  Concerts and Nets utilize this location.  New and clean!!!
5,"I went to Bette Midler's concert in June at the Barclays Center. Not only was the show fabulous, but I was very impressed with the arena (my first time there).  The transportation options are great (LIRR, subways, driving/parking), and they've really improved the area around it too, with numerous restaurants on side streets within blocks of the arena. Despite being a large arena, it had somewhat of a ""small theatre"" feel to it. I will definitely return in the future!"
3,"We had a great night of hockey in Barclays, but I do have some comments on our experience.Pros: it was the opening game of the season, and first time playing in Barclays center. Dispite sitting in the upper section behind the goal, we had a good view of the ice.Cons:Ticket price was ridiculosly high +$100. Food and beverage was way too pricy: 2x Beer + chips (small bag) = 28 dollars. The arena was nowhere near soldout (I suspect bevise of ticket prices)I know it was first time in barclays center, but there are definately some things that could be improved."
3,"I was coming from Long Island.  I took the LIRR which was about a 90 minute ride from Huntington.  One nice thing is the RR provides some express trains from Jamaica to Atlantic Ave so it is probably 10-15 minutes.After getting through the new enhanced semi airport type security, Barclays has a really nice wide open entrance.  We were directed right.  There were portable bars, craft beer stands and food pavilions.  We passed a large team store and up the escalator.  My section (222) was right there.  A food concession stand on either side of that entrance plus separate small stands against wall for things such as popcorn.Inside the upper deck is STEEP but luckily we were in row 7.  A very nice view of the ice although if you sit closer to the aisle around seat 1 there is a very small obstruction with the far same side corner unless you lean forward.  From my exact seats I had a perfect view.The scoreboard is off center but not as much as you would think.  The board is huge, clear and has enhanced stats like players on ice TOI and shots.  Being off center is not a big deal.  The seats are more comfortable than the Coliseum.  Cushioned, slightly wider, cup holders. Barclays has a ton of food choices.  Yes more expensive.  But some things weren't bad like a medium bag of popcorn for $7 that you can refill as many times as you want.  We are the conventional hotdogs, popcorn, Nathan's fries and nachos but they had big burgers, sandwiches and on the lower level what seemed to be access to restaurants.The bathrooms are bigger and cleaner but at least on the 2nd level, they are in the end zones and the hallways are pretty tight.  The food lines are well organized but for a new arena when you get off of the food line have to fight your way through a lot of people to get to where the ketchup, mustard, sauerkraut etc is.  I was surprised to see it didn't have as much space between periods as I would have though it might and the building wasn't full.  When they get 15+k in there between periods might be tough to navigate.  Definitely not as bad as the Coliseum but I thought it would have been a little better.From my section right after the final horn we ran down, got on escalator and was at the LIRR station in 11 minutes.  I just missed the train that would have been a direct connection at Jamaica so the express I did get a few minutes later missed by maybe a minute the Huntington connection.  We saw it pulling out as we ran towards it.  I would say one negative now is like Ranger fans you have to watch the time.  If you miss the train with the direct connection you might have a decent wait at Jamaica.  We waited 20 minutes for the next train but that was because it was an afternoon matinee game when most people were working and they were running a rush hour schedule.  A game at night might force you to leave early so you are not waiting at Jamaica at 10pm especially in the cold otherwise head into a bar at Barclays and wait for the next train.Is it a great hockey building?  No.  It has some great seats, features and things the Coliseum never had or will.  It really depends on where you sit.  But there definitely are quirks that will take getting used to.  I am sure some things will be ironed out but some things like sight lines can not be fixed.  If the Isles sell out who cares but I can say on a day where they were short 4-5k fans, it was quiet.  I like many others didn't spend a ton of time watching the game.  It was about figuring out the building.  I think as time goes on and people have visited it will feel more like home but in the beginning, you feel like a tourist."
5,"The place is brand new and you can tell. Outside facade will be hit or miss for some people and the inside is spectacular. Went for a Nets game, they won. Everything is well done. The best basketball arena I've been to."
4,"This was our first time at the Barclays Center. We went for a hockey game. New is nice and this place is very new and clean. That is why it gets the extra point.The seats were comfy but the game wasn't full and if it was, it would have been very hard to see over everyone's head. Our view was already somewhat obstructed by people sitting 5 rows in front of us. The game would have been more enjoyable if they posted penalty info on the scoreboard. Hint: Turn the guys name red if he's in the penalty box and post the reason why. At these prices, it would be nice to make things fan-centric. Transportation is easy since the train station is located right in the plaza in front of the venue. You don't even have to cross the street. Food was pricey, especially the soda. Small cup- high price! Really??I think that everyone is thinking the same thing. Venue was supposedly sold out but it looked as if more than half the seats were empty. Why the artificially high tix prices??The venue seems small and more intimate than a venue like MSG or even the Nassau Coliseum so it might be nice to see a concert there."
4,"I love this venue ! The atmosphere, the staff, the food and neighborhood. It's a great place for sports and concerts. Take mass transit, parking is a problem."
5,Barclays is an excellent venue. It's easily accessible from the subway and L I RR Railroad.  We were there to see Prince Royce and Ariana Grande perform.  Our seats were floor level second row center.
5,"I love this arena because it bring a complete Brooklyn feel inside. The seating is comfortable for any show, I attended a Nets games and saw live boxing. I sat in the nose bleed section to mid section had a great view in both occasion. I preferred it over the garden. I enjoyed the outdoor drum school by some local Brooklyn youth. The Barclays continues to provide entertainment for all...."
4,"The venue is nice and there's not a bad seat in the house.  The problem is, we wanted a sit-down restaurant before the show and unless you made reservations in advance, you could not get into the only one in the Barclays Center.  There are a number of restaurants in the area, but all were packed pre-show.  It's a nice place, but for the amount of business it brings to the area, there aren't enough restaurants to support it."
5,"Went here for multiple events (concerts, graduation). Each time was wonderful. The seats are too tight though...that was my only issue, which is a big issue for me if the event calls for sitting more than half an hour."
1,"Cramped. Uncomfortable. Seats at too steep of an angle. Parking, horrendous!  How the ISLANDERS will play...in Brooklyn...in this hideous place will be interesting!  Madonna concert. She was  very late to take stage. Seats so close and so steep I had my toes stepped on and drinks spilled on me. All before the concert even started. SHAME on the developers and investors like Jay-Z!! Never going back!!!!"
1,"Just got back from my first  Islanders game at Barclay's. What a disappointment . upon entering I was told that they can't scan my phone for entry. I would need to go to get my tickets printed out. I showed them that it clearly stated there was no need to print tickets... There response was to always print my ticket for any event at Barclay's.   The customer service is horrible in the whole building from the food stands to the guest service counter....  As for the hockey game in row 14 of the upper deck (not even half way up) you can't even read the names on there jerseys. The ceiling soars 20 above your head making the sound dissipate. Not a good place for hockey at all.  After the first period I asked where I could go to smoke during the break, i was told there is no where to go but outside and all exits are final. Then i was lectured on how they were helping me save my life. "" after 7 minutes of not smoking the body starts to heal "" .  Possibly  a true fact, but after spending money on tickets, coffee food ,and drinks my life would of been better if I could at least stand outside for 5 minutes!!!!!!    I will be watching the Islanders on TV from now on... What a waste .... I am sad to see the Nassau coliseum go but was expecting better things to come. It's apparent better things are not found at Barclay's center."
5,The building is so beautiful at night with all the lights. The architecture is amazing.  Inside and out.. you'll want to stop and take pics.
3,"I went to see a recent concert here.The Barclay center is not a mega stadium so even people who sat at upper leveled seating could enjoy a good view of all the musical action. I had floor leveled seating for the concert and I have no complaints on that front either.With gratitude I would like to thank a Customer Care employee that made my experience exceptionally awesome, Ms.T.Gittens, she was very professional, thoughtful and kind. Overall the employees that I encountered there were very pleasant and courteous."
4,"I visited Barclays Center for a Friday night concert. Overall, I thought it was a great concert venue. While there is no parking, it is extremely easy to get to using the subway system. Beautiful building. Drinks super expensive, but that is expected at any entertainment venue these days. Seating wise, I thought the seats were spacious and comfortable, but we were in the first row of our upper section and it is common for the first row in sections to have a little more space."
5,I saw Elton John here on New Year's Eve.  I enjoyed the venue and felt totally safe.  Seat was in the first upper section.  good view close in.    was able to get a drink with ease. crowded but service was excellent - speedy.
4,"I went to the Barclays to see Katt Williams. The show was great, the seat were small, and I almost felt they were too close together. I almost got vertigo looking down to see all those rows of seats. It wasnt bad enough to take away from the headliner in comedy Katt Williams. I enjoyed myself."
2,"the arena is an absolute shambles, the organisation is absolutely awful, everyone was just left to push their way through small doors, we weren't even asked for tickets until wed queued and been through all of security meaning anyone could have got through to that point, food was stupidly priced here and not the nicest, overall a huge disappointment."
5,"My daughters and I visited here for Monday night Raw, a very nice place. The seats were nice. I would love to come back for a basketball game. Nathan's hotdogs are served here and there is a place to charge your cell phones. :)"
4,We were here for WWE SummerSlam weekend. I've been to Madison Square Garden and I actually prefer Barclays. It's the perfect size. I don't think there's really a bad seat in the house. We were up on the second level and could see without a problem. The concessions are really nice with plenty of options. The restrooms were clean. The staff were very nice as well. The entry was a little bit of a hassle but the exit was smooth. Definitely a fun place to check out an event!
5,"Came here for NXT Takeover: Brooklyn &amp; we blew the roof off of the Barclays Center. The venue is clean, the drinks overpriced, and food was good! The drinks being overpriced was not a surprise. Every venue I've been at has the same issue. With it being NY, I expected those prices. I can't wait to come back for my next WWE event!"
3,"It's a very cool &amp; unique structure from the outside view, but the inside is not what as expected.  Seating is nice on the lower levels, but it's too steep when you have to go all the way to the top. If you weren't afraid of heights before, you would be if you try going up there. LOL"
4,"Was here for RAW and really enjoyed it. The Venue itself is lovely but the seats are slightly cramped. The food &amp; drink is over priced but I expected that. Although $6 for a small bag of popcorn is hard to swallow. All in all, a good experience."
5,"We came to watch Monday Night Raw on the 23rd Aug 2015 all the way from London England!!I'm not a wrestling fan but I have to say it was one of the best nights out I've ever experienced!! It was something my partner wanted to do as he's loved it since he was a kid, so I thought why not!! The venue was good, the people were lovely and the atmosphere was amazing!!This is definitely a lasting memory of our time in New York!!"
5,Great place for sports and special entertainment like music and shows. Do not bring a car and parking is very difficult. Place is really first class with restaurants and good viewing throughout.
4,In June took my 10 year old grandson on the VIP behind the scene tour of Barclays Center which he thoroughly enjoyed.  The guide gave us some historical facts and the walk through gave a good view of all that happens and what's available apart from just watching an event.  He even got the opportunity to shoot some hoops on the practice court.  Wow! He's still talking about it.
4,"The Barclays is a very nice blend of a Arena /Shopping Mall.I have been to the New Brooklyn Nets game and its clean,easy access by train arena.Food tastings are geared to all tastes and culture.Very nice for Brooklyn !"
4,We attended the Bette Midler concert here.  FYI:  all of the concessions were packed up and closed by the 1/2 way point of the concert!
4,"Good location,has a starbuck if you need a wii. Was nice to see it up close, it was for a boxing event"
5,"See world renowned performances, local, shows, expo's and more at the Barclays Center. Come hungry as the restaurants are great and the Brooklyn food stands are not to miss."
4,It's a really good place to catch a game. Mass transit is the way to travel. Expensive. Has all events sports family concerts etc... Area around has tons of food and bar scenes.
4,Love the easy access to the seating and great shows.  Lots of choices for food and treats inside to be very satisfied pre-show.
4,Great atmosphere. The arena lighting is great. Makes the court feel like center stage with all lights on the court and the rest of the arena dimmed.
5,"I spent a whole day at Barclays this week, both in the front and back of house.   Never have I seen a more cohesive, caring staff at every level of such a large organization.  Everyone performed at the peak of professionalism and was sincerely caring and personable.  Staff from different departments worked harmoniously together with an inspiring and noticeable respect for one another. Must be a fantastic HR dept. focused on not just hiring the right people, but providing them with the 'best in class' training and motivation. Keep up the good work. Go Brooklyn!"
4,I've been to over a dozen events here since the first week they opened up and overall I have been pleased. The only thing they need to work on is entry...there's always a long line and I expect to be able to be inside/seated promptly if I arrive on time to my event.
5,"Barclays Center is a modern and friendly stadium that operates efficiently and has some great attractions.  I have attended graduations, Marvel Comics shows and have enjoyed myself each time.  No stress if you take the train but be alert and avoid making yourself an easy target in the vicinity.  Thank goodness for the NYPD and their presence in the area."
4,"Now the largest stadium for concerts and shows in NYC. Main tip, if your a tourist staying in Manhattan, definitely take the subway. I took a cab from midtown, and cost was $100 with traffic. Took subway back after show, very crowded but quick &amp; inexpensive. Unlike Australia, my home, they have lots of hot food to buy before the show….. like hotdogs, burgers etc."
3,"I have seen three concerts here including Cher, Billy Joel, and another rock group.  After sitting in the 200 section for the first (rock group) we quickly started paying higher prices.  The rake of the upper seating is terrifyingly steep.  Each person in the row puts out their hand to help you get seated as you hang on for dear life.  Fortunately there weren't any drunken patrons in my section - a major accident waiting to happen. There are plenty of bathrooms, the food is ok, and getting there and back on the subway is a breeze.  Realize you are going to be strip searched (ok, not that bad but you WILL be searched and it significantly delays entrance to your venue) so be early and don't carry a bunch of stuff.  Sound systems can be iffy for some groups - although the later concerts we've seen were better than the earlier ones...maybe Barclays is helping out the later sound managers with more ""how-tos""."
5,"Everyone in NYC must visit the Barclay center.  It is new, it is jazzy, the food choices are delicious and the seats are great from many angles.  I have been there for concerts, basketball games and even special events.  Its cool, its hip and spotless. Madison square garden is traditional but Barclay is the new venue to visit."
5,"Barclays Center hosts our Nets Team, a basketball team.You can watch basketball games when it's in season.  There are also shows that can be seen there."
5,Loved It here. Great time. Barclay center 2015 amazing. Tons of people. City was fantastic ! Will return
4,"Very good stadium. Annoying and repeated overhead (from ceiling and lighting fixtures I think) flashes, probably for photos. Throughout the game. Very expensive beer and wine. Easy public transport especially if you walk to other nearby subway stations after the game."
4,The arena lies at the hub of many subway lines so getting here for those in the Metropolitan area is easy-limited expensive parking in the area.   There are no restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the Center so on a cold night you are forced to eat heartily before the game or pay the very high prices for rather ordinary food.  The ushers are extremely friendlly &amp; the sight lines for basketball are great.  Hockey starts this fall.
5,Amazing architecture by ShOp architects and a wonderful game. There are plenty of concerts worth visiting too.
4,"Went to a basketball game at Barclay's and the Nets won!  Nice arena - but I felt dizzy going up to the ""crow's nest"" lol! Food &amp; drinks are overpriced - particularly when the same items are available in the neighborhood.  Give me something unique - then overcharge me! Decent bathroom facilities &amp; obviously easy to get to - major hub for trains."
5,The home of the Brooklyn Net's. Alway's great venues appearing at Barkclay's. From The circus to Barbara Striesand Etc.Buy your tickets on line way before the event.Take the many subway lines that arrive right in front of the arena. The food stands are extremely over priced. Parking is difficult.The Arena is beautiful and very large.Enjoy!!!!
5,"Great place for concerts, sports etc. It's clean and in a safe area with lots of people, lots of police, high rent area, great restaurants close by, a mall across the street and Brooklyn Academy of Music nearby. Very friendly staff who is helpful in the arena, clean bathrooms, great Brooklyn food in the arena, comfortable seats, great sound system, has 4 clubs in the arena which are luxurious.  I've been there 10 times for concerts, hockey games and basketball and it's the best atmosphere and arena in New York.  Nothing comes close!  Very convenient as it's 200 feet from all train stations and subways. Very convenient from Manhattan by subway or car as it's so close. A must see on a trip to soak in Brooklyn flavor."
3,We saw the Bette Midler concert there and the show was amazing! The sound was great. The Barclay's staff personable. The seats in the 200 section? Incredibly steep and tightly set together. I almost fell shuffling into my seat because I stepped on a cup holder (shoulder height) of the row of seats in front of us. My husband is over six feet tall and couldn't stretch out his legs. I felt flushed with a sense of vertigo in those seats. There's another show co u get to the Batclay's I would love to see but I refuse because of those awful seats :(
4,"This arena  was built over the rail lines in a blighted area and has caused a huge change in the area; it has brought life, industry, and jobs along with traffic. The arena itself is lovely but prices to events are high and the cost for food is also very high probably reflecting their rents. Still getting there is easy as tall of he subway lines in the city seem to stop there as well as the Long Island Railroad and Buses. Better if you take public transpotration there as parking is limited and expensive but it is  a good spot to see concerts adn sporting events."
2,"Food sucks for vegetarians. I ordered the cheese quesadilla and I kid you not, it was a tortila stuffed with cheese and nuked in the microwave. I had to throw it out after taking two bites. Terrible! The pizza was just as bad."
2,"unfortunately it was not very interesting to visit Barclays Center, there was only the usual shops with expensive prices, definitely only worth a visit during a tunderstorm"
5,love going to for concert the view and seating amazing love it best thing for brooklyn. th epeople the area the customer service process is very good enjoy going with family and friend for entretainment
5,"Love the location of this new facility.  Just a few blocks from work and a short train or bus ride from my house.    It's across the street from Atlantic center &amp; LLIR, making it accessible to most trains.  They host a variety of events, concerts  as well as the home to the Brooklyn Nets.  Many restuarants just walking distance from Barclays as well as many popular stores for shopping."
3,We parked on the street and walked in about 4 blocks . The lobby and bathrooms were very clean. My seats were on the suit level section 123 they were like folding chairs so the back of the seat is open the man behind me foot kept touching my shirt until I turned and told him to watch his feet . I'm a small person that sat between to big men my bare arms was touching the guy because the seats to are to small and to close. We went to see kevin Hart the performers and the staff warned you numerous times not to take ur phones out or you would be ejected from the place and they was serious staff removed a lady on my row because she had her phone out they did warn you so it was her fault . I found the staff to be friendly lots of stores in the area good sound system just very very TIGHT SEATING.
3,No doubt the lines move a person's eyes in a sweeping gentle motion along endless rusted metal beams.
5,"A new built stadium at the heart of the city, bragging its design and presence to all who could look at it, a must to watch a basketball game or perhaps a concert."
2,Nice to have another sporting venue in the city but I have found the seating to be uncomfortable. Attended boxing and wrestling events here. The boxing was enjoyable because it wasn't a packed house and I was able to stretch out. Monday Night Raw was packed like sardines and I came to realize that this place isn't for me. Not thrilled with the venue build-out but it has a decent variety of food selections. Try getting here by train because you have to walk quite a distance away from here to find free parking.
5,"Easy in, easy out - rare for an arena for a concert. Convenient to the subway...Or cab if that's what you prefer."
4,He said that to the peolple in the upper level seats he must look like a singing and dancing nose (insert corny joke drum sound here) and the view of the main screen from the sides near the stage was obscured by curtains. But I give the ushers mad props for moving us immediately to better seats when the loud people behind us kept spilling their drinks on us.
2,"I walked up, and from the distance it looks modern and impressive, due to its size and large Brclay's sign. But after a second and closer look, I was wondering if the brown rust color is on purpose or not. A green living roof looks odd. Then there is the main plaza opposite the subway stop. just bare, there is no fan or sports memorabilia, no actual indication of who plays here. Did I miss a gift store or bars/restaurant?I am used to visiting stadium where the actual stadium is an attraction, not this one. Too modern, no characterWe stopped at Starbucks, then sat outside, and the ambiance was stale, this might as well been a government building.I guess if you come to a game or concert and are pumped up with excitement and adrenaline, and at night, it might be a better emotion, but so would an empty parking lot.I was told it was efficient, ok, points for efficiency."
3,"The area around the Barclays is still in development but the building itself is massive.  Lots of overpriced concession stands (which is par for the course in NY) who exercise different vending policies from one to the next (one vendor will allow you to purchase a bottle of water, but another must pour water for you in a cup because they aren't allowed to give bottles).  Pretty chaotic, to say the least.  The suites are too dark with inflated catering prices ($95 for nachos for six people?)."
5,"I traveled over to New York from Ireland to see Barbra Streisand perform in her hometown of Brooklyn in October 2012. It was once in a lifetime to see one of the greatest singers perform in her own town, something not a lot of people can say they did, it was a fantastic show and she was brilliant, I had seen her in Ireland 5 years ago but to see her in her hometown, I witnessed history, I would definitely say it is a brilliant venue, easy to access and easy to get tickets as my tickets were pre-booked and had to be collected by international will call, the staff were very helpful and even other fans were really nice to me, seeing as I was only 22 at the time, traveled on my own here, surprised that I was a fan of someone from a whole different generation, and probably the youngest person there! other fans were more than happy to chat to fetch me some drinks and snacks at the intermissionthe hot dogs on the stands are really good I would recommend them!Also the city rail is just outside it literally ! so easy to get from my hotel to the venue"
5,We were visiting from England and saw the Nets. Good tip for people travelling as we bought our tickets of stubhub and it saved us alot of money getting tickets near enough court side for 90 dollars each. great atmosphere
5,"The Barclays Center is a beautiful new arena easily accessible in Brooklyn at Atlantic and Flatbush as virtually all of New York's public transportation converges there.The outside of the building is very flexible in how it can display photos and graphics adding to the buzz the building generates.Inside they offer many charging stations for your portable devices and their concessions are literally a tour of Brooklyn cuisine.Very comfortable seating and an exceptionally friendly staff greeting you upon arrival, available throughout the arena throughout the events, and thanking you for coming as you leave.Such a different experience than you get at many professional arenas.  I have only been there for basketball games so I can't comment on it for other types of events but considering the wide range of premium seating options and even their innovative underground turntable for team or tour busses I have to believe that it is just as first class for any event they host."
5,"This is a beautiful arena (inside only).  It has very comfortable seating.  Acoustics are excellent as are sight lines. Food and restrooms are all first class.  Other than the outside being ugly, this is a great addition to New York.  Having ten subway lines outside the front door is wonderful also."
5,Subway top right out side main entrance so very easy to access from Manhattan.  Large plaza area outside to hang out in. Shopping and restaurants in immediate area.  Area felt clean and safe.  Venue itself was awesome.  Can't imagine there is a bad seat in the house.  Very well designed but visually and functionally.
4,I dig this place...the fact that's in BK helps a lot Also the line moves very quickly. The food and drinks are very decent...The only thing I would change ASAP is to put in monitors all around because if u sit farther up u can not see...
5,"It is very accesable by subway, bus and by LIRR and it has a shopping mall across of the avenue. And even has restaurants etc....."
5,"We had an amazing time at the Barclays centre this spring time. We came to a basketball game, the entrance was smooth, although you must know they don't let you in with large cameras, so you better leave them at home."
4,"This is a really nice venue. I attended a basketball game as a guest of James Harden (family friend). As a guest of a player I was sitting pretty close to several celebrities that were in attendance courtside at the game. Most were very polite and willing to take pictures with fans if they asked. This arena is really nice and clean compared to a few others I have attended in the pass. We went to the 40/40 Club inside the arena after the game. The restrooms are clean, the food is typical (chicken fingers, fries, beer and soda) for most places like this. The staff is very friendly and polite.   I would definitely attend an event here again. Parking was a little difficult to find as I don't think they have a dedicated parking lot for the arena."
4,"so i went to one of the openings when Jay Z had performed and the concert was great, the stadium is huge but i remember there being problems with the sound. there seemed to be too much bass and it drowned out the lyrics. it wasn't unbearable but at a concert you want to hear everything clear as day. I'm going back for the Kevin Hart show in July so I may have an update for this review."
4,The shopping area at Barclay's Center offers you a venue with almost all the stores you could want.  But the lines to check out in the major mall stores is just too long at most times.  But as I said in other reviews this is the city life.
2,"Went to the March 26 concert of my ""dream""--Neil Diamond and was totally disappointed in the venue not the star.I have seen Neil Diamond everywhere in the Metropolitan area from MSG to Jones Beach and the Nassau Coliseum and despite paying a small fortune for the tickets these were the worst seats possible.Very dangerous and trying to navigate to seats and the concessions expensive.The only bad part of a wonderful evening with my Neil!"
5,VIP service was phenomenal. The express entrance put us in a good mood from the start. Then our seats were comfy. The food taste amazing. And the drinks hit the spot.
5,"If you're traveling to NYC catch a Nets game at Barclay Center. It is one of the newest, cleanest and most efficient stadiums I've attended. Plus you get a festive Brooklyn crowd, and some of the most professional staff around. Also host to other concerts and events throughout the year. For those afraid of leaving Manhattan, most major Subway lines converge below Barclay so its almost a direct point-to-point trip. Great eating in the stadium (for a venue anyway) with all Brooklyn-based foods. Many great restaurants in the surrounding neighborhoods as well."
4,"I have been here for concerts and I must say , I don't think there is a bad seat in the house. The acoustics were wonderful. The seats were comfortable and descending, so you had no problem seeing over the person in front of you. The bathrooms for the most part were well kept and the concession stands were plentiful. The ushers were polite and helpful and made sure to thank us for coming upon our exit."
5,Ilove the Barclays center! Its close to home and its so convienent! The food choices are amazing tons of Brooklyn eats!
1,The seats are completely out of control steep.  It's a death trap.  No exits in sight from where we sat at the top.  If there was an emergency god help the audience.  I will never go back and I will urge friends to not go.
4,"This is Brooklyn's arena, home of the Brooklyn Nets of the NBA and future home of the New York Islanders of the NHL.  It also hosts concerts, the circus, college basketball, pro wrestling, and the like.  It is a comfortable, new arena.  Sight lines are good (though I'm told they won't be for hockey).  Food prices are very high, so eat before you enter the arena."
5,"This is probably the nicest arena I've ever visited - my husband and I went to see the Brooklyn Nets.  Yeah, food and drink is arena prices - so bring plenty of cash and expect it!  But the arena is so nice inside - so clean, the staff we all so lovely as well!"
4,"We had the very top ""nosebleed seats"" for the Ringling Bros. Circus, and the view was very nice.  Also, there were lots of places for wheelchairs at all levels.  Concessions were not too crowded, and food was decent for an arena."
5,"I had the chance to watch a live NBA game, the atmosphere and the extra spectacles are just awesome."
4,"A must do during the season , always tickets available from mobile ticket van outside centre , good value and good venue , a great evening"
4,"Go catch yourself a Nets experience. It's not just the game it's everything that revolves around it. It was a first time in NY so catching an NBA game was a plan. From outside it says nothing but inside it is pretty neat. There is a nets memorabilia store. Everywhere you'll find a nets sign. I can't even begin to talk about the restaurants - two things are a must the fish tacos at Calexico and the cheesecake at Juniors. Make sure you don't miss those two and your covered. Sure the seats are tight and they've tried to fill as many seats possible but watching the game is a true experience. The audience is kept entertained by throwing free t-shirts, the cheerleaders dancing, constantly having the cameras going on the seats. It's a good vibe in there"
4,"We had brilliant night at a Brooklyn Nets game, foam finger, hot dog, beer, kiss cam and cheerleaders! What more could you want... oh yeah Basketball! My husband loved the sport, while I loved the experience - gutted we didn't see Jayzee and Queen Bea (they were there the on the Tue night game with Prince William and Catherine) but it was great and a absolute must when visiting NYC"
5,Had a great time. Nice arena.  Clean. Bathrooms were clean.  Drinks and refreshments are expensive but thats typical of any of these venues.  It was organized and a nice experience overall.
4,Went to Barclays for a Stevie Wonder concert. Sound was excellent. Long lines for security bag check. Didn't have time to check out the concessions. Arranged like a standard sports arena. But it worked for a music concert.
2,"we had tickets to Neil Diamond and wanted to start with reservations at the 40/40 club. tried calling them twice f=during the day of the concert and got voicemail both times with nobody returning our call before we left the house for the show. we arrived early as I requested 630 reservations so we could enjoy dinner and walk around the center. unfortunately doors did not open until 7 PM!! allowing just an hour before show time is very poor planning. we went to the restaurant where they had no record of our reservation but were able to seat us. we did not realize it would be a buffet at $75 a person but at this point we decided to stay.  we sat down at 7:10 PM and immediately ordered a glass of wine each. we then proceeded to the buffet with the plate from our table (this really doesn't work-in theory, someone is supposed to keep circling and asking you if you need a new plate for subsequent visits but we did not see anyone and as a result used our dirty plate for a revisit to the stations.  The food selection was ok but I do have a poet peeve when hot foods are not hot (Pizza was cold and many of the hot foods-burgers, pastas, etc were room temp and sushi was also at room temp, not cold.  no sneeze guards either. we did not get our glasses of wine until after our second visit to the buffet (around 7:35). didn't have a chance to order coffee with dessert either. definitely not a good experience and we will not do this again- the bill with tip was $225 for a very poor excuse of a meal with subpar service."
2,Neil Diamond was great but the Barclay Center is terrible.  You pay a fortune for tickets to sit as if you're in a baseball stadium.  The service is terrible and some of the staff are completely rude.  I will never see a show there again.
5,I saw one of the Cirque  shows here and it as very well put together and the stadium is modern and very clean. Instagram: @tommiesox
5,"Our daughter and son-in law got us tickets to the Neil Diamond Concert at Barclay's for Christmas.  The show was last week, and it was great.  Adding to the show was the atmosphere and sound at Barclay's.  What a wonderful experience!  Getting to Barclay's is great too.  Many train lines go right to Barclay's, so no concern about traffic or parking."
3,This arena seating in 200 section is horrible I have four big boys and me and my wife couldn't enjoy the game we all was falling and really couldn't get set to sit the seats r very tight and close and no room for error. I afraid someone is going to fall and die there if they don't do something about it soon.
4,"Madison Square Garden it is not, however, it has it's own identity, not bad at all. Only problem for out of towners like ourselves is that it required us to drive in, not fun, parking even less so!"
5,"Now this is a beauty of an arena!! The location is super easy to access, the staff is friendly, and the seats are comfortable. Take in a Nets game or an Islanders game here for sure!"
3,"We got seats in the nosebleeds, the view of the court was good but the arena steps in that section was way too steep and I'm not a fan of the dark lighting scheme."
3,"The Barclays Center is a beautiful building outside, but inside the vibe is dull, and that's even during a NETS home game.It's very easy to get to, the subway is right in front of the entrance.There are a lot of different food and drink options inside.The one strange thing is how dark they keep the lights during the basketball game.It is the darkest arena I've ever been too.I'd say save your money and go to MSG, they at least use their lights."
5,"Barclays Center, home of the Brooklyn Nets, was a great time. While the fans were not the rowdiest and the seats were not full, the newly built stadium was impressive.Seats in the upper bowl were very comfortable, a nice departure from other stadiums. They keep the lights very low except on the court, creating a more dramatic and exciting experience - with all focus directed to the action on the court. The main entrance from Atlantic was packed when trying to get in, however staff told us to head around back where we got in instantly - luck we listened to the advice or we would have missed tip off. Only frustrating part was the concessions staff and bartenders, who were not the most friendly and possibly the slowest bar service I have encountered at a pro sports event."
4,"Yeah, so we went to Ringling bros circus couple Sundays ago. I expected a lil up tick in prices, but 12$ for a snow cone in a cup, whaaat?  AnywAy go, enjoy, have fun. But be prepared to empty your pockets. Very nice place though. Oh and if u park across the street in pking lot. Be ready to b trapped for awhile especially if u park in lower level LEAVE EARLY."
5,I gave my daughter tickets to a concert for this arena. She had a great time. We are so happy we have this venue to she shows. It's in a great location.
4,"We came up to Brooklyn to watch the A-10 finals in men's basketball.  Bought our seats at the box office after we parked  about 1/2 mile away, but it was on the street and free.  Subway would be the way to go as there is a station right there.  The exterior is a unique and cool thing to see.  We had seats in the corner near the endline of the court.  Great seats.  Sight lines are great.  Scoreboard and video screen is HD and very crisp.  Seats were extremely comfortable and had enough legroom for my 6'7 size.  Bathroom were adequate.  Food, as you can imagine is expensive.  But it's nice to have such a variety of food available.  Overall, it was a great place to see a game and I suppose a concert."
5,"Stub Hub had tickets to NBA basketball game for only $10 when Madison Square Garden Knicks were sold out at ridiculous prices.  So we took the express subway from Times Square to the station (just across the street from Barclays Center).  Yes, we were in the rafters, but the view was great of both nets and the seats are nicely cushioned, the crowd was polite.  But the nicest surprise was the customer service by each usher and security member - best I've ever experienced at any sport venue. We arrived early, due to the snow storm and Guest Relations cheerfully safeguards packages and some outerwear at NO CHARGE! Bathrooms were plentiful and everything was clean.The Nets basketball team, recently relocated from NJ, put on a great show into TRIPLE overtime.  The Islanders (hockey) relocate here next year! The herringbone wood court was echoed in the herringbone suit jackets worn by staff and black and white outfits the Brooklynette dance team wore.  The hostess of ceremonies led lots of crowd pleasing activities that were family friendly with a variety of music.   Ingress and egress was well marked, efficient and the simplest emptying a big stadium we ever experienced."
5,"New, Clean, great shows, friendly staff, amazing Boxes, come to Brooklyn, easy get to and see a show or a game."
1,I will NEVER go here again. Sound terrible..Seats are very far from the show. I felt as though I was in an airplane looking down on Sir Paul McCartney. Neighborhood around the center is also not the best. Mayor Bloomberg wasted our tax dollars on this! C-
2,"My recent Barclays Center experience was to attend a Brooklyn Nets game on a Friday night.  You know, when you would expect there to be a lot of fan enthusiasm.  It was dead.  The atmosphere at the Barclays Center was horrible.I suspect that one of the major issues the Brooklyn Nets (and the NY Knicks at MSG) have is that everything is so corporate that anyone who can afford seats now are unlikely to be the loud, go-team-go kind of a fan.  I saw a whole lot of people on their cell phones, or just talking to their friends.  Even when the announcer would encourage people to cheer on the team, his voice overpowered the not-even-close to sold out crowd.A second reason that I think the atmosphere was so lacking is the seating.  The way that the seating is designed makes the upper bowl so far removed from the court/floor because of the slope of the lower bowl.The Barclays Center is beautiful to look at, but absolutely boring as heck inside."
5,"My niece and her Irish step dancing group performed before the game and I love how they always incorporate a Brooklyn twist on the events.  We go all the time, and I love all the dancers and pre-game performers.  I always give them a 5*!"
5,"The Center is home to concerts and the Brooklyn Nets basketball team.  There is a city mall very close with nice shops.  Close by, there is the Atlantic  Avenue Subway Station which is a significant transportation hub.  This makes getting here easier than driving."
5,"I live in Brooklyn,  Every time it was special show in town we had to  trAvel to the city msg.  Now we have this amazing unique and assesible place. Is new clean and cheaper than msg. Super convenient,  the suites are great and the food is very good too."
4,"Ok so I live in the bronx and getting to Barclays is pretty easy using the subway, take the 4 and it's right there. Went to a show for first time there yesterday, circus xtreme, which was brillant, but my one complaint is this, this was a kids show @7pm, we were going to the pre show so they told everyone to arrive at 545pm. Last night was the coldest night of the year and especially Brooklyn at that time, there was strong wind, I don't know how cold it was but they left everyone standing outside freezing. I'm talking about kids been left in the freezing cold, looking through the door, with all the ushers and security standing inside nice and warm looking back at us. I had my 3 year old and was starting to worry about frostbite, kids were crying, others were shouting, it was a disgrace. The policy was to open the doors at 6pm, they should have taken into consideration how cold it was and that it was a kids show. Everyone was very nice when we got in but that was wrong Leaving kids in the cold. I didn't buy any food there, too expensive, lemonade $10 etc. we had great seats though, front row, but I did notice that the act tended to pander to the side that had the private boxes. Bathrooms were nice and clean."
5,Had a great time at the Barclays Center - saw Cher's Farewell Show - had great seats and you could see from all locations.  A trip to see a show at  this place is worth-while.
5,"I have now seen about 75 basketball games (Nets) and 10 plus concerts at Barclays Center, and this venue is really fantastic.  It is easy to get to (11 train lines go to within a block or less of the arena - if you drive, you can usually find street parking on side streets between 3rd and 4th Avenue, though I highly recommend you take the subway or LIRR), it is easy to get in and out of (much faster than MSG, you are to the exit within 2 minutes of leaving your seat at Barclays), the food choices are diverse and very good (though I frankly go for dinner before the event to Bark or Broccolino right across from the arena), and the arena itself is a very nice looking arena.  They did a great job.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside is very nice.  And the staff, with just a few exceptions, seem to be genuinely happy working there and are very pleasant and friendly."
4,"We've been to Barclay's Center multiple times - most recently for the Def Jam 30th concert in October 2014.  We also went to a Jay Z concert and a Beyonce concert.  It's typical NYC pricing for food and drinks so take cash or credit.  Sometimes we go to Applebee's in Atlantic Terminal mall before a show to get less expensive food and cocktails; however, it's always crowded if there is an event at Barclay's since others have the same idea.  We have never paid to park and always end up finding free street parking close by.  There is a garage at Atlantic Terminal mall and a few local garages.  The LIRR and subway stop at Barclay's too so you can leave the car at home. If you're already local, you can also take the bus."
5,Came to watch Brooklyn Netz Vs Raptors whilst in New York. My second ever basketball game and 1st ever in New York. although Brooklyn lost it was a great experience. Travel to Barclays centre was pretty easy from Lexington Avenue. just 2 trains and arrive in 25 -30 mins max. perfectly safe in the evening and all part of the experience. food options are great here also.
5,I like the fact that Brooklyn has its own arena/concert hall etc.  Islanders are coming to Brooklyn.  Nets game was fun and even the upper seating was decent.  Saw ELTON JOHN on New Year's Eve-awesome show.  Food and drinks were good and there's plenty of bars and good restaurants in the neighborhood.  Easily accessible by almost every train in NYC!
5,"Wow!!!  Not only am I impressed with the Barclay Center, but proud to have a stadium located in my neck of the woods!!!  Gooooooo Brooklyn!First time we went to the Barclays Center was in January for a Celtic game and both my fiance and I were impressed.  The minute we walked into the stadium I can't tell you how many people welcomed us.....I've never had that happen before especially when I used to go to games at Madison Square Garden.  It was insane!!  I'm not complaining, but the people that worked there were sooo friendly!!!And since we got our tickets as a gift, we were hooked up!!!  Our tickets included the free buffet.....OMG, the food at the buffet was out of this world!!!  I was a bit skeptical, especially with the mini sliders only because they were under the heat lamps and lord knows how long they had been sitting there, but after the first bite, HOLY CANOLI.....those little sliders were to die for!!!!  Seriously, my fiance went back for seconds and after he got his seconds, they had to refill the container because everyone was going for the mini sliders!Granted the stadium is still brand new, but I was impressed with how clean the stadium is as well as how friendly the people are as well.Soooo proud to have a stadium walking distance from my house!!!  Goooo Brooklyn!!!"
4,Easy to reach by car or subway. Modern and very well organized. Excellent view from any place. A significant  shopping center with major chains near by.
4,"This stadium/arena is very modern and looks great inside and out. Im not sure if it was WWE's problem but the sound wasnt as loud as it usually is in other arenas ive seen them in, but this is building is cool to see"
2,Travel to center a nightmare too many busy roads converge there. The center itself good could have nicer places to eat. No sit down resturaunts which is a shame. Advise hire a driver to drop off and pick up
4,"The subway stop is right here so it is easy to get to. The staff are friendly and helpful.  The food a little pricey but you expect that in a place like this. The seats compared to Australia are fantastic, you get a comfortable seat with a drink holder! yes please!. We had no problems seeing the game from way up high (sporting events are triple the price compared to AUS so we had to buy seats way back!) you can still see everything from there. The atmosphere in there was great, we loved it."
5,"I've been to quite a few arenas in the US, and this one is the best, without a shadow of doubt. Best Food. (which is all from Brooklyn, no international chains here, it's all Brooklyn born)."
4,Expensive concessions. But I guess for New York it was okay. Very clean. We were able to get in and out in an orderly fashion.
4,"The tickets are far more expensive at Madison Square Garden so if you want to watch a NBA match, this is the place for far less money to soak up the high energy level and audience participation expected with each NBA match. We watched the Nets vs the Spurs match and it was a cliff hanger till the last minute. Our return trip to Times Sq (42nd str west station) took about an hour but no changeover so it was a smooth and no standing for us for the long trip back."
4,"I'm not into the exterior rusty spaceship crash landed onto Atlantic Avenue look. But inside there are plenty of restrooms, and many booths or stands available selling souvenirs and food. Not surprising considering it's a recently updated new construction and built for multiple types of events."
5,"Love the design of this stadium! Went to a Nets/Raptors game here in January and sat in one of the upper level sections. Court was very nice, designed to look old school and was clearly visible from upper level which has quite a steep incline. Don't sit in the upper sections if you are afraid of heights:)"
5,"remember what they said about Yankee Stadium "" every seat is a great seat"" well here in Bklyn you have that going on and you walk in from the street you feel the energy on approach and no long corridors you ""walk right in""Had a great time- bring your wallet"
1,They were unprepared the staff had no idea what to do. they couldnt handle the all star game. I waited 20 min online for a drink was last in line to be cut off and argue if i was in line or not. THAT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN. they have a great selection for food some places were unatractive/empty while others that i wanted (normal food) were packed(huge lines). i didnt want to miss the game so i settled for a 14 dollar meal that was average at best
5,"The stadium is brand new, very impressive.Great experience. But if you are afraid of heights don't book seats at the top."
1,"We booked tickets for The Harlem Globetrotters in December. As it was our son's birthday we decided to pay extra for The Magic Experience. We arrived at 11, the experience was to start at 1130. As we were from Australia we had to collect our tickets from Will Call. The queue to get in took an hour and there were fights and arguments between adults. At one stage it looked like there was even going to be a fight,not a nice experience, especially with children. By the time we got inside at 1210, the experience was over. We went to customer services who took note of our seats and said we would meet the Globetrotters at half time. No one came so we had 3 very disappointed kids. I was disappointed too as I paid $155 for nothing. After the game we went back to guest services where Ebony Wilson took our details and said they would be in contact. That was a month ago and have heard nothing. Disgraceful customer service and empty promises"
5,"The Barclays Center is a wonderful place to go to a concert.  The suite level was great with an all you can eat buffet for $125, waitress service in a dining area and full bars throughout.  The only down side was that you cannot bring more than two drinks back to your seat at a time, which was an issue for three of us.  Other than that it was a great way to ring in the new year!"
5,"Caught a Nets/Nuggets game this time, thankful enough Nets won this time. Love the features of this building especially the sound and lighting. Try the bottomless popcorn when there. My wife fell in love with it and you can keep refilling throughout the event."
4,"As a lover of basketball I was thrillws to have the opportunity to see the Brooklyn Nets face the Dallas Mavericks. The game was very entertaining, going into overtime, although the Nets ended up losing! The refreshments, however, were very expensive. A beer was $10. This is the norm for a sports arena in America but is still a downside. A great night out all in all."
4,"First time to Barclays Center. Slow getting in and out.Bar service was slow also.Not enough vendors on the floor to serve you,  the one we did have was very entertaining. Elton put on a good show."
5,"Took the LIRR to the Barclay Center on New Year's Eve to see Elton John. The train is the most civilized way to travel-Atlantic Ave station is directly across the street from the center. And other than the train being a bit crowded, and all the open bottles of beer, vodka, whiskey etc being consumed the trip was a snap. The Barclay center has, hands down, the most courteous staff I have ever come across Everyone is smiling and asking if they can help, if we are having a good time and opening and closing doors for you. The only negative was that several of the food vendors were not serving their usual meals. But we did find something to eat. Finding drinks was not a problem! The concert itself was amazing. The stage lighting and special effects were stunning. We were not seated close, but the sound system was top notched. The big screens allowed us to see all the action. Sir Elton played nonstop for almost 2 hours  what a showman. As the new year approached, we watched as Ryan Seacrest cued him in to the live coverage and then he proceeded to play for all of the world! My family all over the globe was tuned in and listening to the concert just as we were! What a tremendous experience. The trip home was equally convenient. The LIRR had added extra trains to accommodate the concert,and a train was waiting as we left the arena. It went directly to our station too, nonstop. What a pleasure. Fantastic way to bring in the new year."
4,"I've only been to a game here, it was fine, it's so nice that they have decent food rather than regular fast food crap.  But, I mean, it's a new arena, so, that's what it's like.Actually I found it a little bit TOO new/kind of soul-less feeling.  But I'm still gravely mourning the old Yankee stadium - just so you know what kind of venue I love, crappy food and all...."
3,"We went to 2 games on our visit to NY. We were up in the bleachers. Section 210 &amp; 223. Its quite dangerous up there, its dark, no lighting, no room between the rows of seats and to make it worse the cup holders are at the back of the seats. So when people are trying to get through, they are tripping over them. Its an accident waiting to happen and last night it happened. A guy fell over falling down 2 rows of seats, food and drink going everywhere. The game was good but just uncomfortable viewing."
5,"I saw the Nets and Grizzlies play on January 14, and I had a great time.  Really nice new arena, and many good food choices.  Subway drops you off right at the Barclays Center."
5,"caught a Nets game with my 9 year old son. The place is clean and comfortable. The staff could not be any friendlier! plenty of people to guide you to your seat and answer any questions.Across the street from the LIRR, so commute was simple. Many places to eat inside, prices are up there but try to get a game ticket that includes all you can eat."
5,"This review is in response to TA's request for a NY's Eve review.  Four of us went to the Barclay in downtown Brooklyn (NY) for the second year in a row.  Last year it was Billy Joel, this year Elton John.  The arena can be configured to seat 19 thousand for a concert.  The location lends itself to public transportation.  The Long Island Railroad is across the street as are nine subway lines.  There is also ample parking across the street as well.  The staff is incredibly well trained and exceedingly polite.  This is a place that gets large scale events right.  After the concert there were dozens of New York's Finest doing crowd and traffic control."
5,We have been there 3 times now for 3 seperate events .. Built well &amp; overall a lot easier &amp; convient then the garden ..
4,"Saw Elton John concert at the Barclay center in Brooklyn. The price of a cocktail was ridiculous for what you got so have one before going there! On the upside, products served are all local origin. Since Brooklyn is such a foodie Mecca there was a lot of variety. We had interesting Cuban type burrito. The center also has a huge candy shop so kids would like that. The sound system in the venue was outstanding."
5,Watched Brooklyn Nets V Sacramento Kings in this GIANT basketball stadium and what an experience. Staff very effecient in dealing with the crowds and also very friendly. Great retail shop on the ground floor to purchase kits. Great experience.
5,We visited Brooklyn so we could visit with family and see a marvelous show at the Barclays Center.  It is very convenient when staying in the area. The amenities are plentiful and lines were not too long. The staff is very courteous and accommodating.  I hope that the locals appreciate what is in their backyard!
5,Went to see the Brooklyn Nets play. The arena is really nice and clean. Plenty of bathrooms and concessions around and the staff was really helpful. We took the subway in and the Q Train takes you right to the arena. We came up out of the subway and there it was. Really easy to get to.
4,Great Venue- Best seats are on the side.. not on the main floor. Sitting behind the stage (for a concert would also be good) Beer and wine are insultingly expensive.  Bottle of water at $5.00 is pushing it for me.
4,"Took my nephews to see the Brooklyn Nets lose to the Boston Celtics. That was the bad part. Worse, we were sitting in a Boston Section so the fans around us loved to see the Nets lose.But Barclay's Center is a whole different matter.Can't begin to explain the knowledge and courtesy of the staff and management.They treat you better than the staff of a 5 star hotel.Literally. Best trained staff ever. Hope it continues.The seats are great albeit a little hard to get to.The Center itself is spacious, elegant and outfitted with wonderful food courts.The Barclays Center is a wonderful venue for family and friends alike.Now let's hope the Nets hustle a little more. A lot more than last night."
4,"I Live on Long Island and travelled by Long Island Railroad to see Elton John on New Years Eve.  If you live near a station where the trains go directly into Atlantic Avenue Terminal, the trip is easy and pleasant.  If you have to change trains or take the subway from Manhattan to Brooklyn, it's definitely too much work for me!   the Center is well organized and despite the large crowds, a sellout on New Years Eve, everyone and everything flowed smoothly.  The NY Police Department even held traffic when the show let out for those walking back to the LIRR and the trains are scheduled to meet the concerts and events.  Definitely go if you can.  I know that I will return."
4,Great location.  Easy to find and get to by subway.  Modern and comfortable facility. Great concert facility.
4,"Overall the experience was a great one. Elton John was phenomenal.  We were a bitcramped in the upper seats, viewing the concert. There was a very steep pitch at that level, but acoustics, TV screen and sound were excellent.  Clean venue overall, and the Atlantic Terminal was great.  We left from Long Island..Happy New Year"
5,"Went to Nets v Kings and had a great time. The venue is great, got through security quickly and found endless choices for either food or drink. Prices were not bad compared to other venues. The seats were comfortable and the staff were more than helpful with any questions. It is also just steps from the metro so it is easy to get around. All in all a great experience."
5,We saw the Brooklyn Nets play the Denver Nuggets at the Barclays Center - what an experience.  Nicest stadium I've ever been in.  The seats are comfortable and there are many food and drink choices.  The staff are very nice and helpful.  We took the subway right to the game - very easy to navigate and convenient.  I highly recommend going to this venue.
2,16 DOLLARS for a coke zero and a bottle of bud lightEnough said.Tickets are cheap if bought in advance otherwise expensive.If your not a major basketball fan and just going to see a game the tickets in the upper sections view is pretty poor. Think twice about it
1,"Where should I start ? The only parking close to the the Barclay is expensive and when the event is finish be ready to make a line and wait for at least 40 mins before you get your vehicle. Inside we went to the 40/40 club expensive and food and service bad really bad ! I don't mind paying for quality food and service, let's just say the Chinese restaurant around my job is better !  And if you want to smell someone's feet, breath or funk you will enjoy this place why well the seats are so close,tight &amp; uncomfortable &amp; if you are taller than 5""9 your legs will be cramp. Izoc center it is for me Brooklyn I love you but they can keep that rat hole !!! Not worth the money travel traffic or aggravation"
3,"Venue size is good, but you are forced to buy their sinfully overpriced food/drinks. Hubby and me went dry for New Year's Eve. At $16 per one-shot mixed drink...they can keep it."
5,"This Barclays Center New Year's Eve event was my fourth Elton John concert over the past decade. The first was in the former Wachovia Center (now Wells Fargo Center) in South Philadelphia, while the next two were at Madison Square Garden. Since I like seats as close to the stage as possible for as little cost as possible, these latter 2 were in Row 1 of the upper level side stage and the first row of lower level stage rear; the Philly seats were in row 5  ""sweet spot front corner"" section 123. My seats New Year's Eve were in row 1 of section 231 directly behind Elton's piano.With regard to Barclays Center: The acoustics FAR SURPASSED what I experienced at both of the other venues and the seat comfort also was a cut above both as well; the first row guard-glass in front of my seat was crystal clear, so no complaints there either! Now Brooklyn Beer at $11.75 per was clearly over-the-top!  I first saw Elton when he was in his mid-fifties and he was great; for a guy who's now 67, his performance also SURPASSED my previous experiences. We headed down to the 2 &amp; 3 Subway at 12:45 AM 2 hours and 40 minutes after he started and he was still going strong; what a wonderful New Year's Eve for me and my wife!PS - I actually got home to my Central NJ house with a NJ Transit connection from the #3 subway at Penn Station in just 90 minutes from central Brooklyn! (Happily, we had heeded the Barclays Center cautionary email about driving to the venue, recommending mass transit!) Ted Shankoff, NJ"
5,"Large, state of the art arena with tons of amenities. The area is expanding with great restaurants and shopping. Nice alternative to the Manhattan crowds and only a brief subway ride away from Grand Central Station. Highly recommend for any type of event."
4,We did drive in to the Barclay's Center without a hitch. Its a hump from Ramsey N.J and we didn't want the New Years Eve crowd on the way home. No traffic in or out. Tip: We got our parking pass on Park Whiz right next to the stadium- worth it with 3 people or more. No safety concerns coming or going. We had a quick bite at McMahon's Public House. Be prepared to belly up to bar to get service at this place during a big event. Food was bar type food it was O.K for what we needed. Tip: drink before to event. A glass on wine and a vodka drink was $22.00 + tip -EEK! We drove right out and had no traffic concerns due to the fact most people take mass transit. Barclay's is a nice clean place. Expect long lines for bathrooms and drinks. Why cant these arena builders figure out this concern? The lines block the hall ways and its makes walking to your seats with drinks a bumpy walk. Elton was great. Sound was great. We will be back. Crimms
5,The staff was fantastic !  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  It made this terrific concert that much better.
5,Lifelong Knicks fan but a few of us bought cheap ($13) tickets just to check out the arena and wow.  It really is a beautiful venue.  You could pretty much find a restaurant that serves any kind of food you could be craving with a basketball game.  I'm pretty sure I saw a barber shop in there too.  Some wine and oysters to go with your basketball game sir?  I think we were tempted to skip the game and just wander around the center.  After all it's only the nets right?
5,"Attended the Elton John concert at the Barclays Center on New Years Eve. My seat was in the upper level directly in front of the stage (section 215) which offers a better view of the concert than the lower level seats in the same location. This tour, which was called ""Follow the Yellow Brick Road"", was in support of the 40th anniversary edition of ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road""; Elton did plenty of songs from that album (""Benny and the Jets"", ""Candle in the Wind"", ""All the Young Girls Love Alice"") along with plenty of songs from other albums (""Your Song"", I'm Still Standing"", ""Levon""). Elton put on a great concert he even had a decent opening act that called themselves Bright Lights Bright Lights. Travel tip: if you use the subway, there's a station on Atlantic Avenue right next to Barclays Center. Since this station can get crowded after an event, when I'm leaving, I walk three or four blocks on S. Portland Street to the Lafayette Street station and take the C train. Not only is this station less crowded after an event at Barclays Center, I get a seat on the train while people at the Atlantic Avenue station are fighting the crowds and probably have to stand on the train!"
5,"It's been a while since I attended a sports event at an indoor arena.  What a great venue!  From the full-surround marquee to the open plan main lobby...you can see right onto the basketball court once you're through the entrance.  A spacious promenade rings the entire arena with great shops, food and drink concessions, and immaculate rest rooms.  You can even get a haircut!  A great multimedia fan experience with perhaps the best part being the staff!  Service with a smile and very accommodating.  At one point during the game a fan was standing in the aisle making a phone call.  I craned my neck for 2 seconds to see the action and out of nowhere an usher shows up and politely asks the gentleman to sit down.  Truly a great family friendly fan experience!Two suggestions: (1) Use public transportation,  9 different subway lines go directly into the arena...2 more nearby plus the LIRR.  (2) Leave extra time for the security line, especially as it gets close to game time."
4,"This Kansas girl got the treat of her NYC trip by getting free tickets to the Nets versus Cavs game. Using the subway to get there was not a problem but trying to find my way thru this beautiful facility was not so clear. Thanks to the wonderful staff who helped me the minute I walked thru the door, I had a great experience. Several staff shared the history of the building, what features were on each floor and even showed me to the open area where ESPN interviews were taking place. Every floor, every staff member was so great to us and I was so impressed.Regardless that the Nets lost, I also got a great sample of Cuban food, sat behind the Prince &amp; Dutches and got to see Beyonce and Jay Z.  All in all, a great night!"
5,My son and I attended our first basketball game a few nights ago and absolutely loved it! The arena is awesome - so clean and well decorated you could tell a great deal of thought had gone into every aspect. The build up to the game was amazing - the game itself was so so with the nets losing but we went for the atmosphere more than anything! The subway is right outside so getting home is never an issue either.If you are looking to attend a game - do it! It's well worth it!
4,"We saw a knicks vs nets game here and I have to say it was a great experience.  The arena is clean, organized, and easy to navigate. Plus, ticket prices are much more reasonable as opposed to Madison Square Garden.  Parking in the area is a bit of a problem though. You're much better off commuting via subway, train, or bus to get here. Besides that it is a great facility."
4,"We visited the Barclays Center to see the Brooklyn Nets against the Philadelphia 76ers on our recent trip to NYC (we got tickets in advance via StubHub). The place was easy to get to on the Subway - we took the 2/3 red train direct from Penn Station. The venue itself is an impressive looking building, and very spacious and clean once inside. You have to go through security/scanner and bags are searchedWe sat in the Upper deck (section 225) near the front (row 6), and despite being high up, the view onto the court was really good. There were many food options including burgers, chicken wings, pizza slices, nachos, popcorn etc, however both food and drink was really expensive and you are not allowed to bring any in from outside. Pizza was good though!All in all, a fun evening, and the Nets won the game which was nice!"
5,"We visited the Barclays Center recently to watch the Nets. Clean, modern, well organised venue - we were very impressed. So handy for the subway system with 2, 3 ,4 ,5 , B, D, N, Q &amp; R lines all easily accessible.Food outlets were good - hotdogs, burgers, fried chicken, mexican all standards at sporting venues. For us the best was roast beef and horseradish on a brioche bun."
5,"Exceptional performance by Sir Elton combined with an outstanding venue was simply an unbelievable combination.  The Barclay's Center is clean, safe, easily accessible via mass transit and has the friendliest staff I have ever dealt with at this kind of arena.  Completely blows away MSG or the Prudential Center.  Whoever is running this place really has their %#$&amp; together.  Great job.  We had upper level seats with a great sight line and EJ put on a superb performance.  We had a helluva evening!"
5,"While I was visiting, I attend the Kanye West (Tribe Called Quest) Concert and the Brooklyn Nets/Portland Trailblazers game. First off, the Yeezy concert was one of the livest concerts I was able to attend. We showed up late to the venue and was able to get the good price. The venue is nice, clean, and secure. The cost is effective compared to MSG. I'm also in love with sports, so I was excited to see what the Brooklyn Nets atmosphere was like and it didn't disappoint, ""Broookkklyyyynn."" Once again, the cost is better at Barclays, we got some very good seats about 7 back from the court. The subway is right there, it's easily accessible. We took the Subway there and was able to walk back, so it's a central location. Remember to visit the 40/40 Club,I was more than impressed, more like new and mesmerized.  My favorite artist (Jay-Z) and one of my favorite things (sports) so it made for a memorable visit to Barclays."
5,Barclays Center is the newest basketball/concert venue in the US (it's in Brooklyn).  The weeping modern curved design at the entrance is is spectacular.  When entering (after metal detectors) you can walk straight ahead and look down on the floor.  Everything is fine except the price of the food (you're not supposed to bring any into the area).  A hot dog is $7.00.  What looks like a 6 ounce soda is $6.00.  I don't even know what the alcoholic drinks cost.  One deli sandwich cost $17.50.  Eat before you go in.
5,I recently saw Luke Bryan here and was amazed how beautiful the place is. It is huge and clean. The seats were great and comfortable. The view was perfect and I wasjust impressed withthe whole place. I would recommend seeing a concert there if at all possible. A wonderful addition to Brooklyn
5,"Parking was easy, I found some on the street.  The arena is very modern, great clean feel.  Blows Madison Square Garden away."
3,The entrance (outside) needs better control system. People push o enter the center then have to pass through security which becomes another pushing/security issue. Everyone wants to enter the center at the same time. The lack of tape or rails to keep people in line is a safe concern. People can get hurt if the crowd push their way to the front.
5,Went to a Cavs/nets game while in town.  Happened to be while the protesters and the Price of Whales was in town.  Little craziness around the area but overall a great experience.  I have been in many centers and believe this one was one of the best.  I'll be back!
3,It is a beautiful arena inside. I've purchased tickets a few times and felt they were reasonably priced. Just dangerous under the open dome. My mother and I fell in front of the place and no one came over. But later they put signs up and put pellets to melt the ice. They should close that spot.
3,"Went to see ""Arcade Fire"" play at Barclay's recently.  Was my first and only time there. I sat in the cheap seats  (only ones available)  and the sound was terrible.  Couldn't follow words due to reverberations.  Barclay's is brand new--acoustics is an old science.  Try to get better seats closer to the stage.  Sound will probably be better."
4,"The place is still pretty new and is solid as day one.  Went to a basketball game, sat in a suite.Ate in the 40/40 club. DO NOT miss this major high light of the day. Had the buffet was well more then satisfied.  Totally worth the money. ALL the food was fresh, hot, and served to a tee. Our entire party was happy for the choice we made to eat there. If you have the option do it. You will thank yourself later. YOU can have a hot dog anytime. As stated in the title the parking was slim and well overpriced. Yes I know it is NYC but $50 for a basketball game, a bit steep. They has to be a better place just a close."
4,If you are thinking about buying tickets I recommend going to the Brooklyn Nets website and check out the 3D seating chart. You can see exactly what your view will look like.I have been there twice in the upper deck. The sides are very steep and go very high. I strongly preferred being 1 section into the corner than along the side because you can sit much lower for less money.
5,Barclays Center is a great location to watch boxing.  The set up allows for good seating and no really bad seats.  The big screens allow people to see the fight in person and on an enlarged screen.  There is a great boxing crowd in Brooklyn and they out together some  really great matches.There are lots of good parking options through parkwhiz.
5,"This is one of the nicer arenas I have visited.  Very modern design.  The concourse is very wide and easy to navigate even with a large crowd.   Bathrooms are clean and numerous.  The concession stands have a wide variety of selections and the food is good.  Prices are high, but this is standard."
4,"We were there for Disney's Frozen on Ice and had a good time.  As usual with these type of events, the souvenirs and food  items were outrageous - but it is what it is..."
4,"Went to Brooklyn Nets vs Orlando Magic game.  Very easy to get too from many subway lines as the station is right outside the front door of the arena.  Also much shopping and restaurants surrounding the arena.  Arena is quite new, I think it opened in 2012 and is beautiful.  Have to say that personnel were very friendly, which I found suprising in an arena of this size.  Some tickets include unlimited food and drink on the first level, so check into that."
5,A great design for this sports center we got the chance to visit for a Brooklyn Nets game. The brand new place has a great design.
5,"Awesome show...  Frozen on Ice ..    amazing special effects and astonishing skating.. Hosted by Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse, with special guest appearances by your most beloved Disney Princesses and characters"
4,"Due to a limited availability of this show around the country, we were happy to take advantage of our NYC stay and let our own little Elsa enjoy the show. It was a bit of a let-down, though. As far as the skater technique goes, I've seem much better productions in Indianapolis and Columbus, OH. Particularly the Elsa part seemed scaled down. I would think that it would be given to the strongest female skater in the company, but as it was, Anna seemed much more experienced. Oh well, you can't get too picky with Frozen."
4,My Uncle myself and my cousin came here to watch our Temple owls play Duke in the coaches vs cancer tournament . It's a beautiful place I've never been to an arena with a candy store and a Barbershop in it.
5,Barclays center is right by the subway. Food and drinks are VERY expensive.  Save yourself a lot of money and eat out before you arrive.
5,Went to the game on Wednesday 19th Nov.   Never been before so we were apprehensive getting there but got the subway from 34th st penn station to barclays centre and was simple.  Security is good you walk through a security arch and have your bag searched but friendly staff.  The lady that served us our hotdogs however was very rude.  The stadium is well laid out with comfortable seats.   It does get very dark though once the game starts which is good for watching the court but not so good if you need to get up to use bathroom/get a drink etc.  Getting back to manhattan was a breeze.  Just walk out the front and straight into the subway
5,"Great new venue to have for boxing or other sporting events and coming from out of state this is a relatively straightforward place to get to.  Came here for Provodnikov/Algieri in June 2014.  The subway here drops you off right at the place, walk up some stairs and your staring it right in the face.  I've been to a number of boxing events here and had a great time every time out.  Nice and new, modern looking on the inside and if you don't want to eat at the venue and pay a little extra, there's plenty to choose from in the surrounding area for food choices as well."
4,Great big venue. Watched the Brooklyn Nets play. Fun time. Very American. I must do thing if you get the chance. Food and drink on tap. Ate high fat fried and had a great time. It's what you do at these places right.  A word of warning. I sat under an air blower and got very cold as did others next to me. Make sure you have warm clothes.
5,"Went to Pearl Jam show here in 2013 and the venue is amazing!  The acoustics were awesome, and the show was amazing. I'll have to come back for a Nets game sometime so I can see the configuration during a NBA game."
3,"Cool arena with dramatic lighting. Expensive arena drinks and food although it appears to all be above average as far as arena food goes. Tight seating, like really hard to get by someone while in your seat. Love the architecture on the outside, clean on the inside. Great place to see a Nets game!"
1,"If you are a senior citizen and can't afford to get tickets at the orchestra level, don't go through what I experiened. In order to get to the upper level seats you have to climb up very narrow stairs and once you get to the top, once again you have to navigate through a very narrow area to get to seat. Don't quite understand how the builders were permitted to build such a hazardous place. I would hope that they will never experience a fire."
1,"I went to a concert on Thursday,  October 30th.   Never knew they allowed people to smoke in their seats and I am not speaking about cigarettes.  People were standing and sitting on the aisles making it very difficult to exit to get to the bathroom,  thank goodness there wasn't a fire because we would of all burned.  Most of the ushers don't seem to care about the safety of the concert goers.   I will never ever return to this center.  They seriously need to get it together."
5,"Me and my boyfriend came to the Barclays Center for Powerhouse 2014 and we could not have been more happy with our experience! With the exception of a drink being $15, but that was expected."
4,It's a descent size venue where you can watch a show and not feel like you are miles away from the stage.  Of course the closer the seats you get to the stage the better it is.
5,This stadium is great! The underground is nearby and its easily accessed! The seats are great and food and drinks are nearby. We loved to watch the Nets!
5,Had an amazing experience here and would love to come back given the opportunity! No bad seats in this place and lots of shops to buy gear!
3,"I saw John Legend here in August. The show was awesome but having floor level seats in the back sucked. Could hardly see since there weren't risers on the floor level so I probably paid the same or more and people who were on higher levels but closer to the stage had a much better seat/view. All it all, it's new and shiny and all that. Haven't been to a sporting event here yet so I can't comment on that. Will definitely choose a mezzanine seat closer to the stage next time."
4,"I was expecting a super modern, clean, future of arenas style building but got a dark, not well lit, run of the mill basketball arena.. It was nice to see what they were able to do with a weird floorplan but compared to all the other arenas i've been to, I was surprised how dark this place. Considering it's a place where you film a fast paced sport for television.. Otherwise the views were cool! I got a decent seat for a decent price. Wasn't gouged at the gate. Food and beer were a bit expensive but I was sure to fill up before going in. But by far, the best was the MUSIC they played during the basketball games! Who ever selected the music should be given an award."
5,"Great new arena. Went here a couple times for a bball game and a concert. Both times had a great time. Nice, clean, spacious seating (relatively) nice selection of food spots and good design that makes it easy to see the floor from almost anywhere."
4,The Barclays center opened a few years ago in Brooklyn and it has become a very popular destination for concerts and nets basketball games. It is a very clean and well run stadium. The architecture (from the outside) makes the trek to Brooklyn worthwhile. They have done a great job with transportation. The subway hub is right underneath the stadium and you can get there from Manhattan in less than 15mins. The area around the stadium is also slowly changing with opening of more popular stores and restaurants.
4,"Its a large venue so it can be hard to enjoy a show, but every time i've been there it was great. The sound is good and although the last show I was at, I sat very high up, it was still a good view. Sometimes you gotta just go to these big venues for the bands you love."
3,The actual center is VERY Gaudy!!! But they've had some pretty good performers there. I got to see Marc Anthony when it first opened and it was awesome. I live about a half hour away if I walked there.
1,"I've been to arena's all over the country. I live on Long Island and used o drive to NJ for Nets games. I was looking forward to this place for the Nets but it is horrible. The Islanders are now moving there and it is even worse. Not only do I have to shell out 43 bucks for an off peak train for me and my fiance to get to the arena on the railroad but it is DARK, CRAMPED and downright unpleasant with the worst angles ever! Especially for Hockey, half of the arena is obstructed view. It hurts me cause she hates it so much she won't even go and this is where my teams play now. I am going to miss my 15 min drives to Nassau Coliseum where I could park my car. The good days are surely over in NY and I am inline for the move to NC between losing my team and the jobs here. The Prudential Center in NJ is much nicer and wider. Everyone moved out of Brooklyn in the 50's and honestly they should have stayed out unless they planned on bulldozing it and building some parking lots and nice modern facilities."
5,There was a gig at Barckley´s Center and I was amazed how well everything was organised. Great Place!
5,"Ok. so I'd be lying if I said this arena is much to look at from the outside, but I've never been a fan of the neo-rust look. That said, this is the most amazing arena I've been to (on the inside). The seats are all extremely comfortable and everything is high tech and up to date. I especially enjoy the great sound systems and excellent free wifi provided at events! Now, I've only been here for basketball games, though I walk by it every day. I've heard that the seating configuration is not so great for hockey games (though the seating for the obstructed view seats are substantially less than they are for all other seats), but thankfully I'm not a hockey fan! Before I forget, I think it is well worth mentioning that the Barclays Center staff are top notch and I felt cared for every second that I was in the arena. Not to mention the vendor options are pretty great, too, though I try to eat before going to games as the vendor prices can be a bit steep."
4,"As arenas go, Barclays is clean and modern and pretty and all of that. But it IS an arena, just like MSG and Izod and Prudential and has all the $10 beers, $14 spirits &amp; $14 sandwiches that all the others have. The food here is better though, and it takes me ten minutes to get home so I like it...Arena problems like nosebleed seats and bad sound are the same here, and a LOT of the seats for hockey games give you an obstructed view.Of all the arenas in the area though (especially since MSG's knee cripplingly tight refit) Barclays is the most comfortable."
5,"This place is accessible via public transit and for parking. It's a dream to come to versus Midtown. It's unique architecture, well designed lighting features, art and areas for seating make this a great fixture in Brooklyn. Great to see a number of the events, concerts, sports highlights and activities that are being organized here at the stadium. Great headliners are hosted here. It makes it easy to get to the Barclays Center, come in for a show or activity, get seated, and have a good view from wherever you are at. This is a great convenience. This is a very modern stadium or complex center. There are lots of things to do in the area before and after visiting the Barclays Center. It's the hub for so many fantastic neighborhoods in Brooklyn. There is top noche cuisine that abounds with cultural and ethic variety in the area. There is shopping, nearby parks, museums, galleries and art, theatre and cinema, shows, music and more."
5,"We had a suite for the Saturday night Arcade Fire concert and believe me they make you feel like a VIP.  we had a private entrance, and private waiter the whole night.  It was not a cheap night but well worth every penny."
5,I went to Barclay center quite a few times while living in BK. It's brand new so it's very clean and very well taken care of. I personally had courtside seats in the Calvin Klein courtside club section on several occassions and it's great! The buffet during halftime is awesome too. Great location-- Great venue!
5,"Saw Katy Perry at the Barclays Center and I was impressed with the facility. Well-laid out, clean and very helpful and courteous employees. Would choose this venue for a concert over MSG or Prudential any day."
4,Been here for a few different events - basketball games and shows. Very nice stadium. Cold so bring a sweater. Food is ok. Would rather eat at a restaurant before or after.
5,"In December, my wife and I attended a P!nk Concert at the Barclay Center.  The venue was very clean and well organized.  It also had a large assortment of vendors with food and drink.  The most impressive part of the Barclay Center however was their staff.  My wife and I had seats in the 2nd row of the balcony seats.  Unfortunately, my wife's fear of heights kicked in and she was panicking due to the seats.  The staff was understanding of our issue and offered solutions and remedies.  While they could not move our seats closer or credit us the seats we had purchased to the purchase of closer seats that were available, the staff worked with us to arrange for other seats to see the performance.  They were also compassionate and very understanding of my wife's fear of heights and helped to calm her.  I am grateful to them and would attend other events at that location."
5,"Awesome show!!!  designers have worked with scientists to create 20 life-size dinosaurs, including the terror of the ancient terrain, Tyrannosaurus rex! Be amazed and thrilled as the greatest creatures ever to walk the earth return before your eyes. - See more at: http://www.dinosaurlive.com/#sthash.11xoPG9n.dpuf"
4,"Attended the Katy Perry Concert here with a teen, hosted by a donor.  It was terrific.  The facility is fairly new and far superior to Madison Sq Garden.  We had VIP Suite tickets (a wonderful experience) and entered through a separate door.   We took an elevator up to the suite level.  The suite was carpeted with two rows of 4 seats &amp; 2 bar seats at a counters.overlooking the center of the area. Behind, out of view of the show, was a small sofa, and counter for food.  Our host ordered delicious Spumoni pizza (famous in Brooklyn), chicken fingers, and hamburger sliders.  All were great.  Drinks had to be ordered in bulk, e.g. we wanted 1 lemonade and had to order an 8 pack.The Katy Perry Show was terrific.  Katy Perry is a wonderful entertainer.  There were 2 warm up acts.  Katy Perry came on at 9:10 and went until 11:10.  The music, performances, costumes, and atmosphere were fabulous.  Many of the audience came in colorful wigs (purple, blue, pink, green), a hallmark of Katy Perry.  The encore included Katy Perry singing ""Firework"" in a Firework ball gown, then flying through the air over the audience with balloons as thousands of balloons and confetti rained over the audience.It was a fantastic!"
4,I've taken my son to so many shows and concerts here it's ridiculous! Having this stadium just a few miles away is awesome. We saw the Marvel live action show and it really surprised me how great the show was done even including toys that interacted with the show. Great seats throughout the arena and so many food options too! I'm so happy to have this new stadium in my home borough!
3,"I have never been so frightened at a concert. The seats in the upper level were almost vertical, like a cliff. It felt like being on a ride at a theme park without the seatbelts. Every time someone had to pass our seats, there was nothing to hold onto. One false move and someone would easily fall down 100 feet and die. There were some glass walls near the security guard area, but only a small rail at the bottom of the section that would not stop me from plummeting to my death. It was like being on top of a mountain. If you are afraid of heights, do NOT buy tickets in the upper level.  Other than that, the arena is very posh, and the staff were very friendly."
1,VIP Tour - very fun and informative.  Thumbs up40/40 Presented by American Express - hosts seem disorganized despite abundance of empty tables but service is very good.  Portions are on the small side and pricey but taste good.Thumbs up to Calexio and Brooklyn Burger for food venuesJohn Legend concert - was accused by person next to me of encroaching on her seat and was not offered any relief by the Barclays Center staff.Arcade Fire concert - was incorrectly told not to use my iPad and was ordered to bring it to Customer Relations to hold for the remainder of the concert.I am happy to say Barclays Center is one of four concert venues in the greater New York/New Jersey area so I have the option to choose other venues for most events and concerts.
5,It was a nice experience to see a new team in the NBA! The center looks kinda small from outside but it changes your mind once you get in. Liked specially the darkness in the bleachers and music was excellent
3,"Went to rock and roll hall of fame induction.Place is close to train(easy to get to).Since its new its very clean.Wasn't impressed with seats-I'm 5'6"" not overweight and found seats very uncomfortable.They rows are tight and narrow.There are cup holders for each seat but they are located on floor by right foot-felt like tripping and falling each time someone wanted to pass or if I went to concession stand(so i went only once). Sound was good and staff was pleasant.My boyfriend and I probably won't go to an event here-he was really uncomfortable.Also think plexi glass should be higher by first row-group in front of us hanging off it...and they wonder why people fall!"
5,"one of the most comfortable venue to go to the concert or to watch the game. New, beautiful, clear and very bright."
4,"The Barklay's Center is the newest addition to the growing number of recently-build sports venues in New York City.  It is airy, clean, and friendly.  Yes, the hockey arena is not centered (the over-head scoreboard is over one of the blue lines!) but it works.  Transportation is wonderful with 9 subway lines and the Long Island Railroad right downstairs.  No wonder Walter O'Mally wanted to move the Dodgers to this location.  I would be careful of the upper deck seats, though.   It is an adventure if you need to leave your seat.  The rows are very narrow and there are no lights above the seats - even dim ones as at Madison Square Garden -  to illuminate your way out to get a refreshment or to use the facilities.  As you are trying to make your way out, in the dark, you then find yourself tripping over a cup holder that you cannot see.  The rows are too steep for a cup holder which then has to be on the floor rather than on the back of the seat at, say, knee level.  Like I said - interesting."
1,"This venue has the worst sound system! I have been to many concerts here, and each time it's the same problem: you can barely understand what the artists are singing! I won't be back."
5,"Run by complacent inept staff.  If things got out of hand place can get dangerous.  A patron in front of us was being disruptive, dancing and blocking everyone's view behind her.  I politely asked her to sit, my wife and I wanted to see New Edition perform 1 song.  She belligerently started screaming and yelling and told us if I don't like it to go get security.  I then asked an usher to ask her to calm down, the usher said she would get her supervisor.  All along this person in front of us is now wildly jumping  around and purposely blocking me and my wife's view.  When we had enough we left, on the way out we spotted the same usher just hanging around. So we asked her what happened to the supervisor, she said ill to get again. We followed her to the supervisor Dencia H, who was unaware that we were next to the Usher.  She told them that a girl was dancing in front of us, the supervisor's response was ""tell them to go home.""  At which point the Usher tried to hush her and tell her it was us.  After I asked the supervisor ""if someone is being disruptive, and doesn't allow other patrons to see a paid for, full price tickets, show, and they complain to the ushers, is there anything that is suppose to be done?""  Ms. Dencia H stated ""that's what you get at a concert, there's nothing we can do about it.""  I repeated the question a few times, and she arrogantly said ""it's a concert what do you expect?""  And she asserted that that is a Barclay Center regulation.  I've been to numerous concerts and events, and when someone is being disruptive, the least the venue workers do is ask them to sit down, or move our seats.  But not even a response, and pretty much ""go buzz off"" answer is unacceptable, especially coming from a supervisor!  Place is pretty rowdy and unmanaged, go at your own risk!"
5,This beautiful new arena has great shows and events. The seating is very steep so all of the seats offer a great view. You can purchase delicious food throughout the show. Many famous local food vendors have restaurants inside the arena.
4,"Saw Nine Inch Nails here on their 2013 tour. The venue had excellent facilities, was clean - and was probably the most modern large arena I've ever been in."
5,"Amazing ! We watched the play off Brooklyn nets Toronto Raptors. What a show, a nice area with all amenities and nice ambiance. There are working hard to propose real events."
5,I love the suites at this place. The arena small and feels very VIP. A must when in town for a game or concert. Food is also great here.
5,"Had a wonderful time at an event with a good friend, his son and my spouse recently. The venue is great in all the traditional ways you expect a sports venue to be great, but what makes the Barclay Center so special is all the local foods you can buy from local restaurants inside."
5,"I went for a Nets vs Heat playoff game.  The place was rock'n!  My seat wasn't down with the stars, but still had good view of the game and people around me were fun."
4,"Went to a Nets game the first season this venue opened. Was skeptical before going there, but the place is amazing. Very beautiful, immense, and love the food and drink options. They added a lot of local flavor to something that is super corporate. Also, went to a Maryland basketball game (Barclays Classic) as well. Had a good time, same kind of experience, different view. Great seats for Nets, a bit higher up for the Classic. Can't wait to see a concert here. This was in 2012 fall but don't have option to add that now as a date."
5,"Aside from the NY gourmet food choices including amazing desserts, it's the only venue that puts the lights on the court and not on the seats so the views of the game are fabulous with no bright overhead lights in your eyes either! Amazing about sums it all up."
1,"It's dark and gray and has nothing in way of viewing what's going on when you are walking around. Walls are gray as I imagine a prison would be. If there's a game and you are on line you have no view of what's going on or what you are missing. Anything above the 100s sections is nosebleeds seats. It's angled at more thatn 45 degrees. I'm 4'11"" and the back of the seat in front of me was up to my ankles. When I stood I had this incredible feeling of falling over. And I was VERY sorry I bought a drink because I had to walk very slowly back down about 30 rows to get to a door that led to the hallways. Not sure who designed this venue but they have no clue what the top is like. By the way since the top seats are so angled even the staff is afraid of going up and down the stairs, therefore you are on your own to find your seats in the dark. The stairs are not lit. It's horrible. I live in Brooklyn and will not go back unless you give me FREE tickets to a lower section. I'm a hockey fan too and good luck to those fans."
5,"Things I love about Barclays. Easy to get to.Top attractions (concerts, Nets,Islanders are coming)Friendly staffLots of food choicesFood is expensive.Drinks are small. Thanks Bloomberg"
4,"We went to see the Nets play.  Format and structure of the building is interesting, different than most stadiums. Our seats were high up but really there doesn't seem to be a bad seat in the house.  Food is expensive of course, but there were some excellent choices. They even had L&amp;B pizza, which I haven't had since I was a teenager.  The one thing that is a drag is parking.  We were coming from upstate so really needed to drive, but if you can take public transportation and save yourself a ridiculous garage fee for parking."
4,"I didn't think it was going to be all that nice, but it is a very well-laid out arena.  They do need to build a parking lot, though.  Parking on the street takes extreme luck, otherwise you have to park in the shopping mall across a pretty tough street to cross with young children.  The food choices inside are great.  Real Brooklyn-style places like Brooklyn Burger are represented there.  Parking is really the worst issue."
4,I visited the stadium with my son for a basketball game. Stadium is new and fairly clean. It is very convenient with the subway. One surprise and disappointment is that the stadium cannot scan tickets from your phone. Shocking as I thought a new stadium would incorporate modern technology into the operation.
2,"I went to the Barbara Streisand concert which was amazing !! However I must tell you , that the Barclay center steps are so steep you can break your head open ! If you have nosebleed seats good luck watching your concert or other. The only good thing I can say is that they had large TV screens up !!  I was smart and claimed to have Acrophobia (fear of heights)  so I went over to a manger and he brought me down really close to the stage !!!!!!!The center is neat and clean and very easy access to trains anywhere, Do Not Drive, parking is bad in that area. I went for opening night which was thrilling for me and her voice is still the same she is amazing and I must say I feel blessed that I went."
4,"I am  not a US basketball fan or a follower at all. I went here with others and it was a great night - better than I expected.Going to ""a game"" provided a  great insight into part of US culture - and the stadium has been revamped.The food choices were very good and a very comfortable stadium - and easy to get to.I have never been to a stadium before where there were hairdressers - amazing that you can get a haircut while at a basketball game."
5,"If traveling from Times Square or Central Park and taking a car or car service, allow at least an hour to get to Barclay Center for an event.  Public transportation is another story.  Security is very tight, and we were asked for our ticket each time we returned to our seat.  The lower bowl seats provide great views, from both the sideline and baseline.  The space between the rows is not significant, and it is a tight squeeze when people pass in front of you, but it's not unbearable. There were plenty of bathrooms and stalls, and they were clean. The food offerings are out of this world and represent the local New York eateries.  If you can purchase an All Access ticket to a basketball game, the food from any concession is included, and it simply requires a quick scan of the ticket and a hefty appetite.  For the additional cost of the all access ticket, it is worth it since the food is expensive here.  The variety of offerings is better than any sporting arena we have visited!  The Barclay Center is worth visiting and taking in a basketball game."
1,We recently saw Cindi Lauper and Cher at the Barclays Center.  Were were in the upper 200 level section.  I have never been so scared to get to a seat in my life.  The stairs are extremely narrow going up.  The rows are so narrow you can barley walk.  And the rows in front of you don't even seem to exist.  It's like you are on a 30 story balcony with no railing to catch you if you fall.  It was horrible.  We couldn't even enjoy the concert as the people in front of us stood up and we were too scared.  I will never to go this arena again. If you are scared of heights like we are - stay away from this arena!
5,The best place to see NBA match!For me it has been the third time @Barclays and I can confirm that the place is simply amazing.
4,"Looking on the outside like a giant (excuse the graphic expression) turd, and stressing a neighborhood in which it is sited, I was pleasantly surprised to see a comfortable and welcoming arena.  Excellent food choices and reasonable lay out, makes a visit enjoyable."
5,"I was impressed I thought because it was not in Manhattan a should be a small stadium,  but it is quite large and with a lot of infrastructure.  Very organized no problems to get in and find our seats. You can't enter with anything to drink or eat,  yoi need to buy inside."
5,"The Barclays Center is fantastic, easy to get to by public transportation or by car, great access to your very comfortable seats. If I have a choice I would pic Barclays for any event"
5,"Great sports arena, strong drinks and interesting wait-staff. The boxing is a definite great forum for the sports fan"
5,"I'm spending a few weeks near Barclays Center and I'm amazed on how organized they are when there's an event. I went to one concert and it was great, perfect sound, comfortable!"
3,"I have been to two concerts at the Barclays Center. The first was Depeche Mode. I was in the 200s section. Do not sit in any of the 200s seats. They are scary as hell. So steep, I needed a Grand Canyon donkey to help me get there.  I spent the concert praying I wouldn't accidentally knock someone over when they needed to get out because there is only about a half a foot to scoot through the aisle, no railing, and people's heads in the row in front of you are at your foot level. There is also NO lighting up there to help you see where you are going. Not even floor level lights or glow tape to guide you. There's really not even any lighting up there when your being seated before and after the show. I also became concerned that someone in the rows behind me might fall on top of me since a lot of beer was being consumed. Looking at what I could see of the stage was almost like watching the show from the window of an airplane, everyone was so small. Only there was nothing to prevent me from tumbling out of the sky and all the way down to the ground, unless I count the people in front of me who may have broken my fall and a seriously weak looking plexiglass rail at the very front of the section. Also, the sound was awful. I am not sure if this was a problem with the show itself (although I have seen DM a couple of times before in different venues and the sound was great), or with the seating area. But then again, maybe I was just too distracted with terror to hear anything but a buzzing sound. The second show was NIN. I sat in the lower levels. Much, much better. Sound was great, view was decent (although Trent really knows how to put on a visual display), enjoyed the show tremendously, except I felt so very badly for the people in the 200s and hoped nobody fell up there. So, Barclays can be great, or terrifying. I think, though, that I will just wait for acts to show up at other venues. Tickets here, even for the horrible 200s, can be exorbitant. There are some nice choices for food, of course it's all pretty pricey because you're in a stadium. If you do a little pre-planning and get there early, you can go to one of many of the restaurants in the area around the stadium that have good food and are a better value, like Fort Greene or Park Slope."
4,"On the plus side it is very convenient from NY subway, had great range of food with out unreasonable pricing and my seats (up in section 209) had a great view of court and scoreboard/replay screen. On a downside the security wanted to confiscate my camera (Canon EOS 550D with only a 55mm lens), luckily they relented or I would have had to miss the game. Also the atmosphere was no where near as good as Madison Square Gardens with a number of empty seats and quieter fans. Timeout entertainment was very good though."
5,"We went to a Nets game last March. It was a great experience. The stadium is very convenient located. The Barclays Center has a real WOW-factor when you enter through the main entrance! Great food- and Net merchandise options, as well as a good selection of drink vendors."
5,"I saw a basketball game of brooklyn nets that I loved. It was a really party. I bought the ticket by internet ""Ignite Tickets"" and received it at home, in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro right away. No problems at all. The chair I I chose there was food included, as a courtesy of blackberry and everything was perfect. All the game is a wonderful attraction, not to miss."
4,Fantastic night out watching the Brooklyn Nets last April (had thought I had posted this review before but clearly hadnt!) at the Barclays Center. Really easy to get to on the subway and as you come out of the station then the arena is truly impressive. Yes of course some of the memorabilia is expensive and so are the drinks and food but look to eat in a surrounding restaurant first and check-out the sports store across from the center as that seemed slightly cheaper. Seating was good and the atmosphere great in terms of sound and lighting. First class venue.
4,"We went to see this new venue.Not a Nets fan,but this place is beautiful.Very clean,many concessions and they do a good job entertaining the crowd.Very expensive and hard to get to if not using public transportation.I feel they are going overboard with spending money right now,the tickets are way overpriced and they are filling the place because its new.Everything aside the Miami American Airlines Arena is still a better place."
5,"This was the whole reason for the NYC trip. Very nice center. Easy to get in and out. Very helpful staff. Had a seating problem that they fixed right away.Very nice asset for Brooklyn, NY"
5,"Awesome arena, totally lived up to the hype.  Went and saw a Nets game even though we aren't fans of them or who they were playing (the Magic) but wanted to see the arena.  Totally classy and clean thru-out.  Great team store too without exorbitant prices.All the workers were friendly and well dressed.  Tip, check out the practice court from the coffee shop on the outside or the inside promenade just north of the main entrance.  TIP - Park close, once you are more than 3 blocks away the police presence disappears and it's rather a scary walk after a night game, lot of homeless and beggars and other shady types abound outside this 3 block radius."
4,Great event and concert. Staff was very professional. They didn't sell any promotional things. Started on time.
4,"My wife and I  had tickets to see Andrea Bocelli with tickets given to us by our children. I researched and checked all issues and parking prior tp our journey from upsate NY. I wanted to get there REAL early and visit a local bar/restaurant. I didnt book parking ahead and it was NO problem , we parked on the STREET, 2 blocks from the center. We were on the main street and lots of people and action. WE got in and were UPGRADED to orchestra level and could not believe our good fortune. The attendants and all the help there were unbelievably nice and accomodating. No one had any attitude or issues when asked any questions and i was very pleased. Thank you to all the staff at Barclays,,it was great. btw we ate at Tony Romas (another review)"
5,"Traveling from Australia all i wanted to do when we got here was go to a game. Playoff season was on and some how ee managed to get tickets! This stadium is designed and built to entertain!!! Great set up, easy access as subway is at the front. The food and drink stalls are all local businesses. The seats all have cup holders and are the comfiest seats i have ever sat in (all padded).Im know a diehard Brooklyn Nets fan!! Great atmosphere the whole game plus we got free shirts with every ticket!Profesional Cameras sre not allowed. Have to hand into front desk on arrival. Staff here were their to help and smile the whole game. Great people Brooklyn. Did your selves proud!!!"
1,"I had recently went to the rock and roll hall of fame ceremony at the Barclays center. While the ceremony was great, the customer service was somewhat horrible. I purchased my tickets from stubhub and nowhere on the Barclays website does it say that they won't accept the tickets if they are downloaded on to your phone. The woman scanning my tickets wanted no part in helping me, she told me that my phone tickets won't scan because the barcode is different and it needs to be the square barcode that's on the printed tickets. I told her the tickets on my phone will be the same one's that are printed, she didn't want to hear it. Basically, I had to leave the venue, print tickets at office depot, go back to the venue and they still wouldn't let me in because the tickets that were printed were blurry. To print these tickets I had to email the tickets to office depot, wait until they received my email and then pay 4 dollars for each ticket that was printed. When I go back to the same women she said I couldn't go in because they were blurry and wouldn't scan. Also, the barcodes were exactly the same on both downloaded and phone tickets. I went to another line and the woman working says she could just manually punch my tickets in and there shouldn't be any problems and it worked. I'll never go to this place again. Ps, your parking situation is terrible. You hold 19000 people and have zero parking lots. Good job!"
4,Terrific acoustics....just stay down in the lower level especially if you are afraid of heights.  Good food courts too. Easy to travel too.....a huge +
2,"Prepare to go broke! Everything is insanely expensive, and you will be blasted with strange alien blinding devices they call lights (it looks daytime at night!). Corporate attraction, this is NOT Brooklyn. Come here if you dont want to experience Brooklyn."
4,"Just saw Black Sabbath at the Barclay Center. Great show, and sound was very good. Parking no problem. I would go back in a heartbeat!"
2,"I have decided to see NBA match during my hockey trip to NY and NJ. I bought a ticket to see Nets vs Bobcats, lower baseline, section 31, row 1. You would say wow, 1st row at baseline...You are so wrong! I have expected superb view and fantastic evening. Instead of it my camera was declared as proffessional one and I had to give it away. It's Canon EOS 550D. Very far from proffessional cameras but yes, it's my fault. I should find out more about the arena regardless the fact that I have visited many NHL and NFL games and also NBA match in MSG with the same camera and I had no problems at all. Stupid policy but again it's my fault. Much worse was that my view was very bad!!!Few more rows in front of me. Ok. I knew it. Temporary rows A,B,C (for basketball purposes only?) etc. but these rows were almost flat, no or almost no steps between rows! So I have seen nothing (I am 176 cm tall and no giants in front of me). Or yes, I have seen the game on big screen just below the roof. Worth of 100 USD? No way! Buy the tickets to row 15 or 20 but not to the first ones unless you want to watch very expensive TV match."
4,"I recently attended the Barclays Center for a Black Sabbath gig on their 2013/14 ""13"" tour which was fantastic.  We had cheap seats ""up with the gods"" which are really high up as the steps up are near vertical but for the price we paid we didn't bother too much.The sound and atmosphere was amazing gtting to hear big hits like NIB and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath was excellent.  The arena is very easy to get to and leave from the subway and as it is a recent uild all the facilities are very good.Would love to come back to watch some sporting event next time"
5,"Is this place considered the ""Madison Sq. Garden Jr.""?  Some may think so but if you've seen its venues its actually just as big if not better than Madison Sq.  Boxing, Basketball, Music Concerts...  All just as big as the historic Madison Square.  Anyone notice where the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was held this year?  Public Transportation easily accessible from the city and a wonderful mall across the street.  Should one of your main reasons for visiting is the Barklay center I suggest rating Hotels in the Downtown Brooklyn Area unless you don't mind paying Manhattan prices and using public transportation (which is not bad all things considered...  Easily Accessible)"
5,It's new and you can tell. Great venue. Some events stop selling alcohol early  so if that's your thing check first.
1,I went here for opening weekend to see jay z I was really looking foreword to it but it was bad like the show was 1hour I did not paid to see hot 97 play for 15 min before the show that make me mad like after the show people  were drunk like they were on the floor but like this not a good center also the people who work here are rude like They don't know how to do they job I'm not come back there
3,"Went to Rock N Roll Hall of Fame Induction.  The cheap seats are as bad as the cheap seats are in any arena. Maybe worse the height is disconcerting and the space between rows is minimal.  If you are in the middle , everyone has to get up to let you through.Two beers cost $24.50, you can get a case and a six pack for that price. A shot was $15. About the only really positive things I can say is the arena is convenient and the food vendors were a great sampling of Brooklyn's finest. I had the L&amp;B Spumoni pizza, just as good as the original.Considering the collusion between corrupt government  and big real estate to take away people's property through the abuse of eminent domain , this arena has a stink about it. Would I go again ? Yeah if seething really really interested me but I'd get seats on a lower level for sure , well if I could afford them. Otherwise , like all other arena events, they are best watched at home on TV instead of the jumbotron from your nose bleed seats you just paid for."
4,"Even if the Nets are not the best team of the league, it's still a great moment.Our day in BK started with the Brooklyn Taberacle (it was perfect), a great french / mexican fusion restaurant (Jolie Cantina), and finished with a Nets game.That was a real nice day !!You should consider this for a NY trip :)"
5,"We are not Brooklyn Nets fan but had a fantastic basketball game evening here.  Take the subway directly to and from the game if you are staying in Manhattan.  We enjoyed several food and drink venues, all of which were tasty and terrific.If you love sports, this venue is worth a visit while in New York, even if you are not a Brooklyn fan.  It's a great basketball game experience."
4,"The staff was friendly - kind - and helpful. That being said this area was uneventful for me. It felt small in comparison to others I've attended events at. Its saving grace is Jay-Z and the VIP areas. The vault was exclusive, not over crowded, and the sips of champagne when you come in at halftime are brilliant. This is surly the best VIP area I've ever been to in an arena. I rated it so highly mainly because of the vault and it's unique concept. It's like a club after the game with music and a fully stocked bar!!"
4,We stayed in New Jersey near Newark Airport and had no problem driving to the Barclays Center.  We had reserved parking in advance which I would recommend.  We found an Applebee's Restaurant very close to Barclays which had a long wait but luckily we had the time.  Barclays seating is tight but luckily our seats were over an entrance so we had a bit of extra room and no one in front of us.  We could really see Billy Joel and didn't have a problem with the sound system.  It was great being there for New Year's Eve - confetti and streamers at midnight along with Auld Lang Syne sung by Billy Joel - fantastic!
4,"Overall the experience was fantastic, nice layout, good food, service, and décor, but took forever to get to and parking very difficult.  Area on the rise, but wouldn't walk it alone."
2,I went to a WWE Monday Night Raw event the venue is nice and brand new and has great potential but their staff needs training.  WWE events permit flash photography the security staff at the entrance allowed me in with my digital camera.  I was taking pictures freely until the Usher Russel abruptly taps me stating to put my camera away.  I told him that its just a camera and WWE permits it.  Russel then yells at me saying put my camera away or ill be thrown out of the arena. During a few moments he comes to my seating area looking at us like I'm some kind of criminal.  Barclays Center Management needs training and I'm now hesitant to go to the Barclays Center for future events.
4,"This building is gorgeous. We went to a Nets game there. It would be great for a concert or an NHL game , if and when the Islanders play out of here. We were on the main level. it was spread out and offered lots of different food beyond the typical popcorn and hotdogs."
5,This arena was designed for multiple functions. It was well thought out the sound system is amazing. Many choices of concession stands a lil pricy but its and arena great food choices as well.
5,"We had a great first experience at  The Barclay's Center Arena. We went to see a Nets basketball game and had a wonderful time. The lighting was great and music was great for keeping everyone in a good mood. Staff was so helpful. Easy access to subway,and many things in the area to help keep you busy or entertained until your event began. Wonderful food. Good variety instead of just popcorn and drinks. Looking forward to another event soon. Also easy access to restrooms and quite clean. Very nice surprise."
4,"Had a Catered dinner provided by Hp. Barclay center did a great job with the food and service, Watched the game and enjoyed the company"
4,Cool location (right on top of the Subway station Atlantic Avenue).Great entertainment. Don't be afraid to hop over from Manhattan.
5,Netrate concepts was GREAT getting me choice seats for a Nets game in Brooklyn NY...they also arranged a nice hotel within walking distance...GREAT SERVICE
5,"We visited to watch the Nets take on the Lakers whilst on holiday in New York. We couldn't of picked a better game to watch and was by far our favorite memory of our trip.This venue is great, we had amazing seats, the atmosphere was fab and the food was lovely (all local i believe).  Easy to find from the subway and as spectacular on the outside as it was on the inside, we wish we had given ourselves more time to take a walk around it."
5,"Excellent game.  Amazing great, big, fantastic statium.  Way too many people of course, long lines to get beer or food....but well worh the wait.  Easy to get around."
5,"We went to Barclays Ctr. to see the RHCP.  Being that it was superbowl weekend I thought it was going to be chaotic.  It was so organized.  We got right in and security was great and the workers did a great job.  We drove in because I was with my teenage girls and didnt want to ride the train or subway alone at night with them however, you can get there by train to Grand or Penn and then take a taxi to the ctr (about a 20 minute ride) or just take the subway in and get off right in front of the Barclays Ctr.  We had nosebleed seats for the concert but it wasnt a bad seat.  The bathrooms were so clean and the lines werent long and they just were so organized.  Driving in wasnt bad either.  I thought it would be much worse but it really was not hard.I definately would go there again.  And I thought Brooklyn was beautiful.  It is NYC in a different way."
5,"Barclays Center is the Brooklyn Nets stadium. I've been there twice. I had the chance to watch the Brooklyn Nets vs Orlando Magic (for only USD 15) and a John Mayer concert. Both of them were a superb experience! The stadium is really beautiful, great view from everywhere, well organized, clean, good security (you must pass a security check at the entrance), and employees are very kind.  If you are in NY it's a must see. Subways to get there: B, Q, 2, 3, 4, 5, D, N, R, LIRR"
5,"I recently went to New York and bought some court side seats to a Nets vs. Lakers game! It was pretty good.  We had access to the Calvin Klein court side club which offered us all kinds of free food (I myself thoroughly enjoyed the cold crab fingers and boiled shrimp)!  The hospitality was nice and the fans were what was expected from me!  I definitely got a full taste of Brooklyn that night!  It's a nice arena, I would suggest stopping by if you're in the area!"
4,My wife and I came up on the train from Virginia. The Barclay center is so centrally located you can sleep anywhere in the city and reach it easily by most subways. This is our second year to this facility and it is still as beautiful and well kept as ever. The ushers are most helpful and cheerful. We love the openness of the center and the jumbotrons are quite clear. The food inside is adequate but the phone charging stations is above and beyond
5,"Saw Pussy Riot, not the Nets ... so can't comment for sports fans. But loved it. Downside: food and drink is expensive (like all stadiums) ... Upside: cooler neighborhood than I thought it would be"
4,"This is a great venue for any event!  I was here for basketball tournament and it was superb!  Good food choices, great restrooms, easy access via public transportation and very accommodating and helpful staff.  Yes, the prices for everything are outrageous, but no one forces you to eat or drink."
5,Ultra modern stadium with great seating and good view. Local food vendors make for a great experience.
5,"AMAZING! It was my first time at Barclay's -- and I was impressed. It's brand new but has a charm about it reminiscent of older more established arenas. We were sitting 'behind the stage' but for a Billy Joel concert, there's really no such thing.The staff is over the top friendly and the place is immaculate. It's easy to get to via mass transit, but we parked less than a half mile away for under $20. There are great parking recommendations on the Barclay's website.Minor negatives: the concessions were pretty expensive; the sound quality wasn't the best I've ever heard, and the line for the women's bathroom was ridiculous, but overall it was still a positive experience."
5,"Ok, finally checked out the Barclays Center for a Nets game with some friends. The Nets vs. Golden State. Took the no. 3 train, walked out the train station and there are loads of people at the front entrance of the Barclays Center. It took us 15 minutes to enter the Center. Inside, the new center looks really nice. This is the best time to buy food and Nets memorabilia. Locating the seats was not bad. I sat in seat 14 section 218. I was surprised at the view from seat. I can actually see and recognized the players on the court without looking at the screen. By halftime I was acclimated to the Center, so I decided to head to the bathroom and get a bite to eat; that was a mistake. The bathroom line was long and the food line was ridiculously longer. Ran into my friend and he wanted to buy a drink. The drink line was considerably short. The second half of the game was enjoyable the Nets won. The exit out the Center was ok, but there a mob of people at the entrance to the train station in front the Barclays Center; this is the reason. Someone barricaded the part of the front entrance to the subway station so everyone gets bottle necked trying to into the subway using a few stairwells. Got to the 4 train and there were people stuffing themselves into the subway cars as to be expected. What I didn’t expect was the train to sit for another 10 minutes in the station. Well all in all it was a fun night at the Barclays Center and to quote General Macarthur “I shall return”."
4,The new Barclay's Center is easy to reach. A subway station is right in front of the entrance. We saw the game between the Nets and Milwaukee Bucks. Its a great facility and still smells like new.
5,"Great fun night, huge crowd involvement, great game so much to watch, loads of fun. A real all American experience, fast food, sport, loud music, entertainment, cheer girls, young kids basketball demonstration games. A great night out."
5,"My first live NBA game done right! As a tourist in New York and my first time in Brooklyn, I was so relieved the Barclay center was so easy to get to. The Barclay center looked awesome with large picture cut outs of the Nets players, tons of merchandise and not to mention comfy seats to watch the game! The staff was attentive, excellent sports food (Brooklyn burgers and beer), great local atmosphere, loud and fun cheering fans!"
5,We had a great time at the Barclays Center for the Nets vs Heat basketball game. The vast array of food and the small feel of the arena was awesome. I very pleasant experience. Just wish more cabs were available afterwards.
5,"I can't express how much fun I had seeing Jay-Z perform at his home!!!! Besides the show that he put on, the Barclays Center has to be one of the best concert venues that I've ever experienced in my life. The staff was very quick and effiecient with getting everyone in and seated. Better than the smaller venues that I have been to. The restrooms were clean. Barclays Center is huge! We even had to take pictures at the entrance because of the outside decor. I can't wait to go to this venue again."
5,We saw the brooklyn nets for $15! The stadium is impressive. Great night out. We were seated way in the back but excellent value for money &amp; intro to the nba atmosphere. If you can see a Knicks game at Madison even better (we did both) but this was great too plus the Nets are doing really well this season. RiRi was courtside too!
5,Barclays center is a brand new arena and what a design. It is beautiful. You'll clearly enjoy a basketball game there.
3,"We went to see Billy Joel on New Years Eve and I was almost as excited to see the Barclays Center.  That being said, our seats were high up and very tightly spaced vertically.  There is enough room side to side, but the design is very poor as far as room in front of each seat.  It is such a hassle and really detracts from the experience when the whole row of people has to stand constantly to let a person pass.  Plenty of food and drink venues with a lot of variety.  All typically overpriced as they are in stadiums, but he name brands of fast food eateries was pretty impressive."
4,"Have been to several venues but usually steer clear from NY because taking the train to Madison Square Garden is sometimes a pain in the neck, and driving in New York City is often times a nightmare. But i figured i'd give seeing a show in brooklyn a shot...not the actual city, so maybe a bit easier...i was right. And although there is a subway stop that drops you right in front of the venue, we decided to prepay for parking in a nearby valet lot....$15 and a 10 minute walk. Not bad. There were several parking lots surrounding the theater so it made driving there a tad less of a nightmare. Once inside the theater i immediately noticed how friendly all the staff was...ticket takers, ushers, even concession staff, were incredibly friendly. The sound in the actual theater was AWESOME...and i think thats very important. And the seats were very comfortable which is a miracle nowadays in venues. I would definitely go to another show at this theater."
4,"Great venue, but poor junk food and poor beer. Good seating but no great atmosphere. I compared it to other places I had been watching basketball and the building is fantastic and modern but zero atmosphere compared to places like the Garden in Boston or best, but a long time ago, the Key arena in Seattle"
4,"One of the best concerts ever go Brooklyn . I went to the concert with my wife and my son who was visiting from fla and we had a blast. Great performance ever.....,,"
5,"We watched the first ice hockey match of the season at the Brooklyn Nets, Barclays Centre. The seats are quite steep but you can see everything really clearly from every angle. Acoustics were great. Food and drink as you would expect, expensive. All the door staff very friendly. A really enjoyable experience."
4,"We saw Ben Folds Five and Billy Joel on New Years Eve. The security clearance was very efficient and lines were non existent for a sold out show. I immediately noticed a nice aroma in the venue and an usher mentioned that they pump scent in to the air. I suppose if you had allergies, this might be troublesome but we loved it. The ushers were very friendly and engaging despite being stuck  working on NYE. Sound quality was very good. There are multiple screens set-up for concerts but our seats (section 212) we're partially obstructed by lights that were rigged. This was only a minor concern. While there I bought a beer - $12 and was kind of flat. I suppose that's the way it is now, but still think its a rip off.I would go back - extremely conveniently located. Most (all?) of the subways stop here. Ample parking (625 Atlantic Avenue) that can be bought in advance, though it didn't need to be and I feel that we may have overpaid. Seems they were only charging $20 and we pre-booked at $40. Seems that there were lots of spots left and this was a sold out event."
5,I saw Beyoncé's Mrs.Carter concert here two in December 2013. Lines were long because of of security clearance (metal detectors) but moved quickly. We arrived during her opening act Luke James' lackluster performance and there were plenty of friendly ushers with flashlights to help with seating. Restrooms are crowded at concert venues but there are so many bathrooms that I kept walking and eventually found one without the long lines and clean too (shocker!!). Also I get cold very easily and I was comfortable enough to keep my coat off the entire night wearing a short lace dress. I did not buy any food but from what I could see it was regular concert venue junk food ex. Popcorn and alcohol. Beyonce was amazing I sat very close to the Bey stage and was able to get a good look at her when she zipped through the air and landed on the bey stage to perform a few songs. My hubby is a Jay Z fan so I might take him to Barclays when Jigga gets there.
1,"Barclays is a welcoming arena on the outside and as soon as you walk in, but I don't like the seating/views for shows/events.  My family and I saw Billy Joel on NYE (he was amazing by the way), and our seats were in the 200 level (top right corner when looking out from the stage), row 17.  The stairs to get to our seats were the steepest in any arena I have been to. It was actually kind of scary walking to and from our seats.  The space between the edge of your seat and the seat in front of you is extremely narrow.  Also scary! There were large screens on the stage which were helpful, and a jumbotron in the middle of the ceiling which did absolutely nothing, since the Nets banners were completely blocking the view. Can't they raise the banners higher?! Drink prices are outrageous.  For an arena that has much better views, prices, and holds roughly the same amount of people, Prudential Center is the way to go."
4,Barclays Center is between 3 to 4 Blocks from our house.  At first many people in our neighborhood thought this would be a big problem with people going there taking up street parking and clogging streets.  This has not turned out to be true at all. Instead it has given us the opportunity to see everyone from Barbra Streisand to the Harlem Globetrotters perform locally.Services such as restrooms and refreshment stands are plentiful and provide good service. The only complaint I have is that the seats are so sharply banked that at times it feels like you are going to fall down when entering or exiting your seat. However to the best of my knowledge nothing like that has ever happened.
5,"Went here for New Year's Eve for Billy Joel concert, it was incredible! He never disappoints, his performance is non stop. First time at this venue. I was very impressed on how smooth everything went on such a busy night. What impressed me mostly was there were many means of transportation on getting here. Several subways took you right to the door step. And security was present everywhere, offering help with directions. It was wonderful will not hesitate to come here again."
5,"The Nets have been bad this year, but their ineptness detracts little from the Barclay's Center. It is beautiful, comfortable, and has great sight lines and fine food and drink choices. It is easily accessible by subway, cab or livery(the livery cars line up outside the main entrance after the games)."
5,"This is a great venue for sporting events and concerts.  There are simply no bad seats and it is small and intimate feeling.  It is very modern, sleek and clean but still maintains a certain Brooklyn charm/attitude.  It almost feels like a ""grown-up"" college arena.The food/beverage choices were excellent with standard stadium fare (burgers, dogs, beer) and some nice upscale options (sushi).     The fact that it has a transportation hub (subway and LIRR) is a big plus too.  Brooklyn definitely did this one right!"
3,It may be great for a game but for a concert it sucks! The sound was deafening and not clear. Was dragged to see Pink. Sorry I said yes. It was like an amateur circ de solei (spelling?). I thought I was listening to the GoGos. Anyway not my kind of music and the place is better suited for Sports. One man's opinion.
3,"Stood in freezing rain 40 minutes to then be told we were at wrong door for VIP entrance. Automated system didnt alert us the doors not open until 6:30. Check emails for last minute updates, even if you are on the road and no access to email. This is a MUST!"
5,"This is a great centre for NBA, etc. Several Metro lines and many bus routes hub here, the stadium is modern and clean, concessions are clean and readily accessible, toilets are very clean and staff are very helpful.We were up high for an NBA game but saw everything clearly. To an overseas visitor, the atmosphere was terrific and facilities excellent. Loved it."
5,The area is well designed; we had floor seats and the acoustics and site lines were great.  the Calvin Klein VIP room before hand is worth the $$$.  The bar and buffet are incredibly well staffed.  People who work there very nice and accommodating for such a large venue.  Pink was amazing; had never seen her live but this was the best concert i've ever seen.  She is truly the hardest working live performer!  Challenges herself; her dancers and acrobats are truly the best there are.  And to be able to fly around the area on a wire with no safety nets you have to really have trust in your crew.
4,"Easily accesible by train/LIRR, not as much by car. Street parking is limited. Stadium is well-designed, good view from most of the seats. Food/beverages are OK, even kosher stand is there"
5,I was impressed with the friendly staff. They went the extra mile to make sure you enjoyed your visit and they thanked everyone as you left the arena
1,"Went to see Beyonce' last night while I have been to just about every venue in the NY,NJ, CT area I'd rate the people who work here on a scale of 1-10 a 1!  My daughter is in a wheelchair and while ALL the other venues (with the exception of City Center, NY) have people assigned to assist the patrons who are wheelchair bound.  These people could care less and don't ask those in the Grey jackets anything because for the most part (there was one man who was helpful) they are going to give you the WRONG information.  But the worse part I found was...we were located in one of the sections designated for those who are physically challenged I actually saw people who were anything but go into their wallets and give the usher money to let them set in the handicapped seating.  Even if the section wasn't full and you decide to let someone else set there WHY WOULD YOU TAKE CASH MONEY!  That leads me to believe that 1. you pay them crap and 2. you don't train them worth a darn.  I was just so upset because these people were a pain all they did all night was video tape the entire concert.  we paid well over 200.00 a ticket to attend this concert and now it will be available for 5.00 from someone who was allowed to set where they didn't belong.The level of professionalism is just a little toooooooooo tacky for my blood and I can't tell you I will ever go back there again, I don't care who is there!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Being a massive basketball fan, I jumped at the opportunity to take in my first game here at the NBA's newest arena. The outside design of the arena is very futuristic and starts to build the excitement of taking in the world's premier basketball arena. Inside, it's evident that Americans really take their sports and entertainment seriously! It was easy to get inside and through the security barriers, and immediately we were faced with the Brooklyn Nets shop, numerous bars and food outlets and also a view straight up the court! It was mind blowing! Heading up stairs we found it very easy to find our seats, and also plenty more food and drink stands. Nachos, pizzas and hotdogs are just a few of the food options available. Once in our seats, it was well designed as each row was fairly steep allowing you to see over the top of the row in front. I thoroughly enjoyed the in game entertainment as well, with dancers and crowd give aways frequent. Leaving the arena was also very easy! Overall, this building was incredibly crowd-friendly!"
5,"I attended a concert here and the staff could not have been more welcoming. Everyone I encountered from the front door staff, security, escalator attendants, ushers and even the concessionaires were genuinely outgoing and helpful. It is also a nice, new, beautiful arena and it has great access to the subway lines - they are literally within steps of the arena's front doors! I would definitely attend another event here."
4,I have been to a lot of concerts at a lot of venues and Barclays center holds its own with the rest of them.
5,"While some love the tradition and history of Madison Square Garden, it is hard not to love the beautiful and fan friendly sports venue.  We saw a Nets game and some college basketball and loved both.  Great viewing, AMAZING food options.  An all around great experience."
5,"The Barclays Center is a nice arena. I went to a Nets game last year and my family had a great time. We are planning on visiting the arena again with Garnett and Pierce added to the lineup. The staff was very nice and there doesn't seem to be a bad seat in the house. Tickets are a little pricey, but so is everything in New York!"
4,"Barclays is probably the nicest arena that I've ever been to. Even the staff was dressed up. Everyone we encountered was very friendly, and the security was somewhat rigorous but at least you felt safe there. We had nosebleed seats, which at the time I purchased them I thought they were pretty expensive, however after seeing Barclay's firsthand, I now understand why. The sound was good, the view we didn't have any food but the concessions looked good, and the beer was over-priced just like any venue, but they had a decent selection of drinks. Getting to and from the venue was pretty simple from the subway. I definitely would like to go see a game or another show next time I'm in the area. I would highly recommend seeing a concert at Barclay's."
4,This is where the Brooklyn Nets play and where major concerts are held.  It sits above the Long Island Railroad as well as being a major transfer stop for the New York subway system.  Tourists come just to take a photo and see the arena.  But a walk around the neighborhood during the day would also be interesting.  The mall across the street is substandard but the architecture of downtown Brooklyn is astounding.  Find the Academy of Music along Lafayette street and visit the surrounding shops and restaurants. This spot should be on your list if you're in New York for a week. Check to see what event is on during your stay.
5,"1st visit last night for UConn hoops  game.  barclay's at night, lit up, looks like a space ship landed in brooklyn.  gorgeous in side and out.  not crowded concourse like many arenas.  numerous food &amp; drink vendors.  super jumbo-tron/scoreboard.......and the Huskies won!"
3,"It's a new venue so I'll post a quick review:   The Barclays centre in Brooklyn NY is a shiny new ""mini-stadium"", seating around 15,000 ppl.  It's only 2yrs old and it shows by the buildings condition, design elements, cleanliness (even the washrooms!).  So yes, it's a very nice, cozy-more-intimate place to see a show.  I felt the audience played a bigger role than it would at a larger venue where not everyone joins in/seems more distant.  It's pricey though: bad stadium food was $8hotdog, $13 for a mixed drink (using no name booze).   Staff were easily available and pleasant to talk to though. This would be a four star review if I didn't feel so badly gouged by the concession stands."
5,We saw Kentucky play here Dec. 1. And we was very impressed by the arena. I wish Lexington would one exactly like it! Its Incredible!
3,Located in Brooklyn this new arena is very good for watching Basketball and easy to get to. The subway comes up right in front of the arena. The outside is I don't know what. Rusting metal looks better at night.Great restaurants in the area plus legends like Juniors bakery. Great cheescake.
1,"The arena is new and beautiful, but it was not meant for Hockey. The scoreboard is off center, no seating behind one of the end zones, just did not feel right.The area outside is crawling with Police so it is safe,but venture a few blocks away and keep your head on a swivel."
5,We saw Phoenix at Barclay Center on Friday Oct 2nd and had a great time. This area of Brooklyn is really nice and has a lot of restaurants and places to hang out. The facility was clean and the people working there were kind and helpful. Expect to pay the usual insane prices for food and drinks.
4,"Attended the first NHL game there last Saturday night. Getting to the arena from Manhattan can't be any easier. When you surface from the subway you are facing the front of the Barclay Center. Across the street is the LIRR station. Does not appear there is much parking close to the Arena. Getting into the actual arena could be better. When you enter the building there are rather unorganized/undefined lines channeling you to a security person where you are hand-wanded. I think they need additional security people. After that you walk a short distance to have your ticket scanned. Signage was easy to follow to our section. We had seats in section 20. Not bad for seeing the game. As other reviewers have pointed out, this building was not designed to host hockey games. As a result there are some oddities. One end presently has no seats and above are Loge seating with very few people. The scoreboard is not over center ice and the glass side seats are elevated (at least in our area they were) so you are not seated at ice level, you are actually close to even with the top of the boards.  Plenty of food &amp; beverage service concessions around, including branded ones. Restroom access was no problem during the game. Exiting was also easy with access to the Subway a sort walk from the front door."
4,"Nice venue located in the heart of Downtown Brooklyn. Easy accessible to train station for Most of the service line such as 2,3,4,5,N,R,Q,B,D, and LIRR as well. The entrance is right in front of the Venue's main entrance. You never need to worry about transportation problem after the event. On the contrary, it's hard to find parking in that area.You may have to drive couple blocks aways to find public parkings or pay for parking. Also one thing i have to say, its the seating in the venue. the seats is very steep, you have to walk carefully in the dark."
5,I liked the seating It was my friend's 60th birthday so I decided to take her there We love the Circus.  We had seats in the last row first 2 seats they were so comfortable and we saw everything I was so impressed.  We always went to Madison Square Garden to see the Circus but I loved it here.
5,"This september I went to the Atoms for Peace live show. This is was unexpectedly amazing and nothing in common with the recorded sets that you could listen to. The center is very good organized. It's easy to get there, no lines before the beginning and after the show's end. The sound, light, organization deserve A. Restrooms are always close to your seat area exit."
4,"I went here to see The Postal Service. I liked the venue very much! I think the best feature of the venue is all the types of food they sell; I loved the selection! In terms of the seating and sound, I found it to be comparable to other good venues I've visited."
5,"We recently attended the Rodriquez concert at the Barclays Center.  We were quite impressed.  It is a wonder of lighting and other electronic displays.  It was very clean, including the rest rooms, and the seating was steeply tiered, and thus you had no ""head in front of you"" interference with your view.  The best part of center is the capable and friendly staff.  There were lots of staff members to guide you, they uniformly greeted you with a smile, pointed you in the right direction, and wished you a good evening.  I joked to one that they were going to destroy the stereotype of the surly New Yorker.       The drinks and food were priced at a highway robbery level, but they were no more exorbitant than at any other such venue.     I'll leave with a futile protest over the way ticketing goes.  We bought tickets on-line weeks before the concert and put in for ""best available.""   We were seated in the nose -bleed section.  As it turns out, the concert was far from sold out, with many closer seat empty.  My guess is that the arenas, promoters, whoever, sell huge blocks to ticket outfits for the secondary market.   Many of these often go unsold, which means that us regular folks wind up in Siberia, whether or not there are good seats unsold."
1,"With a very small (almost no) exception the staff is completely incompetent and does not know what they are doing. They are not even trying to communicate with customers in order to explain the situation. Instead, they choose to push you out wherever they think you have to be without saying anything. I purchased VIP tickets for the 10/26/13 Sensation White and every single time I walked out to the bathroom or to get a drink, security or whoever they are on the doors used to give me a hard time on my way in. EVERY SINGLE TIME without even attempting to explain why can't I go back to the section I purchased a ticket to. I'm pretty sure it would be quite annoying and would feel disrespectful even if you would pay for the regular ticket, but with VIP section this us absolutely unacceptable. What did I pay for? Did I pay to wait in the line for forty minutes just to get the drinks from the bar to my friends? (oh, they wouldn't let you purchase more than two at the same time, so in line waiting time doubles up if you have more than two people with you). Once again, I paid for something they call VIP/luxury ticket. If this is something Barclay's center management calls VIP or luxury, I guess they must do something about the way their staff is trained, otherwise it feels like you are visiting some low end place in third world country. And to finish up the story, after the THIRD time I had to wait in the line for close to half an hour to forty minutes just to find out that I won't be able to go back to my VIP deck until the end of the night, I left the place. Barclay's center, you are welcome for the money I gave you for nothing; next time I'll bring my money elsewhere."
3,"First and foremost, I have seen hundreds upon hundreds of shows and sporting events at venues all over this country.  I am going to base this review on the other venues I've been to (in the NY area) and my experience at this venue FOR THIS EVENT ONLY!I am going to tell you, this place was packed to the limit with people.  There was not one empty seat in the house.  We arrived 45 minutes prior to when the band went on stage at 8:30.  Getting in for other events that are not sold out might be easier, but for an event like this, you need more then 45 minutes.  They have several long lines to get in (which is expected at an event like this), however, people were able to walk right to the front of the line and cut right in to the line...(I know that happens at almost every event, but...)Once inside, be prepared to walk thru a metal detector.  I'm all about security but it certainly makes the process take a lil bit longer.  You'll need to remove your keys and cell phone.  I'll say the process to get into the show was much worse then venues such as MSG, Jones Beach, and Nassau Coliseum based on events of the same size...but it actually wasn't THAT bad...I've been in much worse...The walkways on the inside are pretty narrow for being a relatively BRAND NEW venue.  Definitely more narrow then MSG and probably on par (if not smaller) with Nassau Coliseum.  I definitely was not a fan of the layout of this place...If you like long lines, you'll be a fan of the Barclays Center.  I'm going to tell you, this venue is not prepared for shows of this size.  We waited on lines for everything.  From the bathroom (yes men, there was a huge line for the bathroom), and the escalator (again, people cutting right in line), and beer or food...this place just could not accommodate.  They have lines for concessions blocking the walkways and when you finally get to the front of the line (after being pushed and shoved because you're blocking someone's path), the beer is warm (being pulled from the cardboard box ready to be served to you!)  As far as I'm concerned, the choices were limited.  I bought 4 beers (2 per person limit per visit) and spent $48.00 bucks.  Again, maybe at an event that's not this size, the situation might be a lot different (clear walkways, cold beers, no lines) but, I would have rather been anywhere then the Barclays Center if not for Pearl Jam.  I took a trip to the concessions during the show and the situation was not any different, the lines were just as long, even actually walking half the length of the corridor trying to find a section with shorter lines!We missed the start of the show because of the lengthly lines, so, of course when we got to our seats, there was enough room for 1/2 a person for the 2 of us.  It took about 7 songs, and 3 visits to security (visits made by a friend in another section) to get someone to come down and check the tickets for each person in our row to ensure everyone was in their right seats.  Now, I'm not THAT GUY who wants to bust chops, especially when the show has already started but when you spend $90 a ticket, you're not going to have someone else rubbing elbows with you in your seats and make you feel like you're out of place. I'd have to say because their lack of competence and laziness, the attendants really would have caused a fight if it went there...I was seated in section 228, and if you like heights, this is the section for you.  Holy smokes, it's steep...I'd obviously think that any of the mezzanine sections are that steep, so, buyer beware!To sum it up, they could use some training when it comes to a big events at the Barclays.  I personally will give it another shot, but if I had to rate it on my first visit, it did not pass the test.  The walkways are narrow, the lines are long, the staff is lazy, it's expensive and for the price, at least stock some cold beer!  The seating from the Mezzanine is not for the faint of heart.  They might have had good food choices (albeit expensive I'm sure) and it may have that ""new venue"" feel to it, but BIG DEAL!  Being that it's new, it should be ""STATE OF THE ART"".  That impression, I did not get...Did I also get to 100% of the venue? No, but this review is based on what I experienced...The pluses...PEARL JAM!  They rocked! The sound is phenomenal at the Barclays and they had 2 huge HD video screens (being we were side-stage mezzanine) with at 5 cameras focused on the show! So, that was a nice touch...I expect crowds, lines, etc...but this was out of control.  You might say, ""You only gave yourself 45 minutes, of course there's going to be lines""  but it's not a matter of timing though, it's a matter of the venue being able to accommodate the crowds so they could get their food &amp; drink, without the lines, without missing any of the show, and being able to sit in seats you purchased without having to contact security 3 times...the venue just did not accommodate and the layout was not conducive to large crowds!It's easy to get to (I'm from LI, just hop on the LIRR), so as far as that's concerned, it was fine.   Others that I spoke to at the show had the same sentiments as far as the experience.  Hopefully the next experience will be a little bit better!  Hope this review helped!"
4,"well laid out, wonderful subway access, great attractions, super star performers, and of course, basketball"
5,"I went for a regular season Nets game and the NBA Draft. This place is great, and perhaps they train well, because the attendants are all very nice while doing their job. The upper level has great viewing and the lower level is of course, fantastic. Everything is very crisp. Can't wait to see a game with the all-star roster!"
4,It's state of the art.  I enjoyed walking around the center.  Not far from downtown Brooklyn where you can walk to shops and other restaurants.  Food trucks are also around and the food is pretty good.
5,Loved the seating at the Barclays Center. The only bad seats on in the 200 section. Do not get tickets there. To far up to see. Seats were very comfortable and sound system is great. Paul was unbelievable and always.
5,Great staff.  Not a bad seat in the house. Saw Depeche Mode there and the acoustics were great. Very convenient location.
5,"I have been here on 2 occasions one for the Hopkins fight the other for the Garcia fight, both times we had vip clearance and the staff was very helpful and accommodating.  I cant wait to go back and watch some more top notch fights ringside :)"
5,"Visited the Barclay Center for a concert and what a fantastic venue.  The exterior design is amazing as is the sheer size of the interior.  The only problem being that they ran out of beer just over halfway through the concert.  Nevertheless, a great experience."
5,Love this place--there is no bad seat. Whether you are there for Brooklyn Nets or for Depeche Mode it is fantastic. Can't wait or the first hockey game on September 21st.
4,"First let me say that I live on Long Island and downtown Brooklyn is usually not the easiest places to get to but the Long Island RR Atlantic Terminal is only 1 block away. The LIRR also adds trains on event nights. There's plenty of mass transit that stops at Barclays too. Driving may not be the way to go. The arena does not have any parking. There's only private lots and street parking and parking could be about $30-$40.As for the Venue itself: It has a beautiful exterior. A lot of the food vendor's are famous Brooklyn eatery's so how can you go wrong with that. The concourse's could be a bit bigger. I saw a concert (end stage set up) and the seats were not great. They were upper level on the side stage and way up. The sight lines were not great and neither were the acoustics. I did view some videos from smartphones taken in the pit from the same show and the sound was much better, even on a phone. I would suggest finding seats either lower or in direct line with the front of the stage. MSG still has better sight lines and acoustics, IMO.When they built Barclays, they really didn't figure it for ice hockey. when hockey gets there in 2015, they have to re-arrange the arena and they will lose almost 2000 seats and one end would have very little seating by the glass. We'll have to wait and see how that works."
4,"Barclays Center is a fantastic venue. There are some great food choices, but they can be expensive. A Cuban sandwich and a soda came to $17. Bottles of water are $5. The staff here are wonderful. Each and every one of them is friendly, helpful and professional. I was very impressed.Now, my only complaint is seating. We were there for the first NHL game played in Brooklyn (Islanders vs. Devils) and granted we didn't have expensive seats. Be warned: up in the 200's section it is steep!!!  There isn't enough room between rows. When someone in your aisle needs to get by, even if you stand to let them pass (as everyone did) you will get your feet stepped on. No getting around it. When sitting, I felt like my knees were in the neck of the person in front of me. On the plus side, they do have cup holders. Next time we'll opt for more expensive seats and hopefully have more room.The venue is easy to get to via LIRR or subway which is great. Love that there is a Starbucks right in front of the venue, with outdoor seating. Most of the food counters and the main souvenir shop are located on the concourse level. Upstairs, there seems to be much less of a choice.Best tip: choose your seats wisely. Pay a bit more for a more comfortable experience."
3,"We saw Beyoncé on the last night of her Brooklyn dates. The building was impressive (I imagine a GREAT place to watch Basketball), but the sound was poor for the majority of the concert which was unexpected. I'm not a fan of Beyoncé (we won the trip) but I expected better. Getting into the venue seemed to take an age: doors were due to open at 7, but at 8pm there were still thousands of people waiting outside to get in. I understand the need for security but these queues seemed to take an awfully long time to move. I'm assuming the sound problems were show specific so would be interested to return to see a band I actually liked."
4,"Went to see the Broner-Malignaggi fight and was sitting in the nosebleed seats. Wasn't an excellent view, and had to watch the screen a lot.Great arena though, excellent location and top notch facilities inside. Have plenty of food vendors at reasonable prices if you want to buy a burger and plenty of bins too.Staff are really helpful. You can't leave the arena once they've scanned your ticket, so if you walk in too early, be aware of this.The boxing was great, and the crowd really makes the atmosphere. If you're going for a sporting event, I highly recommend it."
5,"This place is very clean , easy to find , friendly staff very good place to go and the food is a bit expensive but over this place is nice ."
4,The Only knock is they did not have parking in the actual facility. The surrounding area is slightly concerning to walk to your car at night.
4,Walk around on the outside - great shops - structure of building is gorgeous!  There's a wonderful mall right next to it.  The inside is wonderful and seats are great.  Try and get tickets for a show.
5,It was so nice to have such a wonderful place to stay after spending time is such an overwhelming city.
5,"I saw Beyonce perform there.  First time going to this venue.  Needless to say that Beyonce was stupendous.  It was the setup that impressed me.  Didn't look like a sports arena at all.  Stages on both sides. One was large and deep, the other was kind of circular and runway looking.  Large screens made it easy for viewing.  Sound was sometimes too loud but expected in this type of place.  Vendors come around but selling liquids and popcorn.  You need to get out of your seat for the array of food."
4,"Came here for a Nets game while staying in Brooklyn for the weekend. You are able to walk from most apartment complexes in the area and you'll see a lot of people doing just that - the area is safe. I would recommend printing your tickets ahead of time because their will call is a bit disorganized, but if you absolutely have no way of printing, there is a staples store across the center that will print them for you (free). The sound system is good here, the jumbotrons are on point and it felt very spirited (go nets)"
5,it is a very modern arena with all the necessary facilities.  It is conveniently located and super easy to access via public transportation.  The staff across the arena and the different services is (surprisingly) very professional with a high level of customer service.  It definitely add to the experience.  The food is also a strong point.  All the concessions provide different and local food.  Just not your typical arena - just much better.
5,"If you ever come to New York, please don't forget to come to Brooklyn and visit Barclays Center. Beautiful building, excellent concerts and all types of activities."
5,"This place is CLEAN, big, beautiful and easy to navigate. What a great place for a concert!! The food was a little expensive but that is expected."
5,This beautiful arena seemed very well run and organized. Great experience....easy to get to and exciting seeing an event there!
5,"This was actually the highlight of our NYC trip! my wife, myself and our 16 year old son all agree - this was really amazing! Bought tickets from Ticketmaster - high up long side, but we had a great view of the game! And what a game and what a show. There were things happening all the time, even in the intervals, time outs etc. This was really an experience that we can recommend to anyone. And we were not really interested in basketball before the game, now we are hard core Nets fans!"
3,"Went to see Paul McCartney.  Went online and saw that parking was listed as EXTREMELY LIMITED.  Oh no--but found parking facilities within 2 blocks--not bad at all.  Employees were so helpful and very friendly.  Show was awesome. (But any show of his always is!!!)  Only problem I saw was the fact that it was pouring for hours before show started---had to wait in rain for 45 minutes before they finally opened the doors.  Not very pleasant, but when the show started--all was forgotten."
5,If you live in Brooklyn You do not have to travel anymore to a event. It is easy to get there and you there lots of public transportation to get you there. The arena is so beautiful and has brooklyn written all over it. Brooklyn finally has finally in a long time have a professional team back there since the Dodgers left brooklyn. In 2 years you also can see Hockey there so lets go NY Islanders and Lets Go Brooklyn Nets
1,"We paid alot of money to see Bruno Mars at Barclay Center and sit in section 207. Big mistake!! The upper section, the 200's are dangerous!! There is no room to get by anyone in the row. You are looking straight down, and feel like you will tumble down a few hundred feet. They tried so hard to pack as many people into the upper deck. Terrible experience, I don't know how it passed the building code as being safe. Avoid at all costs the 200 section!!!!!!!!!!! P.S  We obviously are not the only ones that had problems with the 200 section, management told us the best they could do would be to relocate us to the honda standing room only section, which had hundreds of people there!!! Couldn't see a thing!!"
4,"Went to see a concert here, getting to and from the Centre wasn't too bad, those driving closeby, be warned, it's quite hectic just after the concert finishes and not many drivers showing the courtesy of understanding that when your way is not clear, don't enter and block the road.Apart from that, acoustically very good, good amenities and transportation links and information"
5,"Okay, so I ended up here by mistake due to weekend changes of the subway system.....however, it was on my list to see at some point...even if not attending a concert.  The style &amp; design was quite appealing to my eye and camera!  Now can't wait to see a concert here."
4,"For a big music venue you get a lot of help and personal attention. Everything was very clean and new and there were a lot of bathrooms, so the lines don't get too long.  As always though, the beers and drinks were expensive, but no more than any other venue. The elevation of the seats is a little scary, helps with the view, but climbing up and down can be pretty nerve-wracking"
5,We went to a Killers Concert in May 2013.  The venue is beautiful and so modern!  There was a ton of security but it was quick and easy to enter the venue.  The hallways are huge so you don't feel crowded when everyone is leaving the arena.  The acoustics were good and the seating was comfortable.  Food/drink prices were reasonable.
5,great place fr a concert and a sports game it feels smaller then it is and thats great because u dont feel lost  and they have a full kosher counter and thats absolutely amazing so now i can munch on as much food as i plz and not some lil snack i bought from home while ur munching on a 6 course meal   either way great place especially for brooklyn peeps no parking or hassles  just a short train ride away and ur literally in thebuilding
5,"I'm a native Brooklynite and I was really hesistant about accepting this huge venue in the heart of Atlantic/Flatbush Avenue.  I thought traffice would be ridiculous but I've been proven wrong, also there are great eating options, transportation options steps away from the venue.  Another must see in Brooklyn."
2,"Went to see Paul McCartney, and whether it was because our seats were upper level (I tried everything in my power to get awesome seats and it was a no go) and side stage or their sound system, everything sounded muffled. Definatley not the greatest place to see a concert. If you go and see a show there do your best to get in front of the stage and not the side or you'll be disappointed. Also, it was a little steep climbing up there, I've been to other places and was seat high up and this was the worst. Very narrow and cramped. If you can't make it sound crystal clear for all audience members you shouldn't be allowed to host concerts."
4,Very clean and accessible by subway. Was hoping there would be a few sit down restaurants in the center but there was not.
5,"Went to see Paul McCartney there last Saturday night.  I thought the show was great but really any musical review of Paul is going to be influenced by if you like his music or not.   If you like his career you definitely enjoyed the show.  If you don't care for his music, WTF were you doing there?  This is a review of the experience at the venue.Anyway the thing I found most interesting about this arena is they had to fit it into a very small footprint... and some of the consequences of having to fit in add to the benefit and detriment of the place.As far as the staff is concerned, they were excellent.  No problems whatsoever there.  Everybody was cordial.   There was the typical security checkpoint thing but over all things were well managed.Inside, the whole place is really monochrome.  Black, grey and white are the colors.Food selections appeared decent to me, at least for an arena. I had a brisket sandwich from Fatty Cue and it was good.   I give the place credit for trying to accommodate local places. Not a lot of tables (they are tables to stand and eat) available for people who wish to buy food and away from their seat.  But on the other hand things like that are non existent at football stadiums like Lincoln Financial Field.Now, to the seating and getting around the place.  As I mentioned, the place is on a small footprint of land for an arena like this.  This means there are lots of compromises they had to make to build the place.  The lower level concourse seemed spacious enough... but we got there early and might not have been subject to the max crowing situation there.Getting to the upper level is a bit of a trip.  We took the elevator up... again because we were there early it wasn't a problem.  I imagine it's not so easy if you arrive later.  They have at least one escalator but it seemed like it was getting backed.  It was unclear to me if there are any ramps or stairs you can take to the upper level.  You can definitely take stairs down after the show.The seating:  This is an arena built on a small footprint.  That means they had to jam as many seats as possible into a small area.  The seat width was more than adequate but the pitch in the upper level was very steep... maybe as steep as I have encountered in any venue.  But this insured the view was good.  We had an unobstructed view of the stage and I was very happy with it.  In my opinion the biggest problem with the seating was there was very little room for people to pass down the row.  You had to stand up to let people by and even with the best effort it is precarious for the people walking by like a tightrope.Finally, the location.  This is an arena in a great location.  Central Brooklyn deserves a spot like this.  Very easy to get to via mass transit.  This may change for Long Islanders after they finish the East Side Access project and LIRR trains to Brooklyn run from a different terminal in Jamaica.   I took the subway and it was fine, but they do not appear to have a lot of trains in reserve waiting to carry passengers home after the event like they do at Yankee Stadium and Citi Field.  But I guess it's not as necessary here because so many subway lines cross hereThey also have a lot of bike racks surrounding the arena.  That's good but keep in mind the area is basically traffic mayhem. Lots of cars and lots of wide roadways with cars wanting to travel at high speeds.All in all I gave the evening an A. Nothing annoyed me which is somewhat rare.  Ok... one thing. I don't like that they take the tops off of water bottles you buy.  But the vendor informed me of that in advance."
5,Hey Madison Square Garden! You better step up your game or Barclays Center will become the best venue in the city...if it isn't already.
5,"We went to the Paul McCartney concert at Barclays 6/10/13. The building itself is new, clean, and best of all, the employees are friendly, helpful, and genuinely enthusiastic. Every single empoyee we encountered was incredibly nice and super helpful. I felt like I was out of state somewhere. It was so unlike New York's usual brusque attitude, especially in a crowded, busy venue like this. We had upper level seats, but they were in direct line with the stage, so we actually had a great view. In addition, there were two giant video screens on either side of the stage. The seating is steep, as previously mentioned, but this arrangement does bring everyone closer to the stage. Also, getting there is easy. We live in Eastern Long Island and took the LIRR, changed at Jamaica, and then continued to the Atlantic Terminal, which is almost directly across the street from Barclays. If you're leary about Brooklyn, don't be. The area around the arena is clean and modern and perfectly safe. The Atlantic Mall is directly across the street and has shops and several restaurants, however the retaurants were all packed with lines out the door before the show. We learned that there are a number of places to eat inside Barclays and will eat inside next time. The concert was fantastic, by the way. Can't say enough about the employees. Best service we've received outside of a resort!"
3,Saw Paul McCartney here- sounded great. Took forever to get in- One entrance and slow security-theatre. Great restaurants nearby in Park Slope.
4,I wasn't too impressed with the layout of this place. It seems like they packed as many seats as possible in there. The 200 section would be a nightmare to sit in. It is totally straight up and very high and seems so far away. We were there for a concert and I couldn't imagine the people in the 200 being able to see the band. If you are going make sure you get seats that are in the lower sections. I'm sure it is a lot more money but it will be worth it.
3,"Barclays Center is big, loud, crowded (don't even think of driving there, hard to get in and out of, overpriced, has lousy sight lines, just not a good place. I'm really disappointed that after so many years of waiting for a professional sports team, this is the arena that Brooklyn got (to say nothing of the team)."
3,"All the big name restaurants in Brooklyn are represented--I guess except Peter Luger's.  But prices are high, but given the choices--I have to say--I cannot complain.  Even Junior's cheesecake can be enjoyed during the game!"
4,"Went here to catch a Nets game when we were in Brooklyn. The arena is nice and new, so it was clean and easy to get around. We had seats in the top section and still had a good view of the game. Staff were all friendly, and we got free programmes too (which is novel at sports these days). Go catch a game if you can when you're in town, it's easy to get to on the subway and loads of places to eat nearby."
4,Attended Nets game. All seats are good. Walkways are narrow for getting around to restrooms &amp; food vendors.   Try parking at one of the remote parking garages to save money and traffic congestion.  Neighborhood is safe.
5,"We went to a Nets game on 4/4/2013 and got the tickets that include concessions.  It was an amazing experience.  I really couldn't believe it every time we went up to get something new that it was all included.  The food, service, seats,  and facilities were all great.  Definitely eat Junior's cheesecake last or else you will be done in."
5,"One thing I'm going to miss about Park Slope is the Barclays Center. A stroll down 7th Ave, a left down Flatbush, and I'm there. Yeah the rust looks terrible, but it's grown on me. The food inside serves up your classic NYC foods at stadium/arena prices but that is to be expected. I like the fact that they have Juniors cheesecake! One day I'm going to get the nachos if I can only remember to not engorge myself on hotdogs and beer. The seats are good anywhere. Even the cheap seats are good, especially at Jay-Z concerts because of all the ""smoke"" that filled the upper level. I just wish I remembered more of that night. I swear, I couldn't even tell you what songs he played. But yeah, concerts...grrrrrreat!Broooooooklyn Nets are always a good time.I'm pissed that the NHL couldn't get their crap together so I could see the Devils play the Islanders for their preseason opener.  But whatever, first world problems. They'll be their next season, and I will be in Toledo, missing all the action at the Barclays Center. Enjoy it people!"
5,"Barclays is an absolutely stunning venue. From the exterior to the many impressive hospitality spaces and sightlines inside to the local food available inside, it has a lot to offer. A main subway terminal drops you off right in front of the venue. The rich and well-connected can have access to a lot of different exclusive spaces, but even standard visitors can get a lot from visiting this venue. Friendly, engaged staff look you in the eye and welcome you."
5,Not just NEW the Barclays center is the most tasteful and classy arena I have ever visited. All train and bus connections make this easy to enjoy a game or concert
4,"Went to Barclays Center after the Zab bout. Nice area, but didn't find much to do after the event in the area so just went back to the hotel in the Sunset Park area. First time at the Center though and it's a nice place and very clean."
5,"I recently went on the VIP experience for a band at the recently opened Barclay Center. It was hard not to think everything was top notch. The staff / ushers were friendly and motivated to help- a very positive feeling. Everything is new. A wide selection of foods including gluten free, vegetarian, and kosher options. I look forward to seeing another show there."
5,Seating is great almost anywhere - great food (pricey too) and fun atmosphere.  Building is really interesting too.
2,"We went to a game against chicago and the place was nice and easy to find but our seats were brutal.  We were in section 110 row 2 seats 1-4 I believe.  Paid a fair chunk of money since lower area and marked up tickets but prepared for that.  What I didnt expect was a blocked view from my seat.  ticket said limited view so I went to 3d view from seat on nba.com and looked at view before i bought it.  It shows some bars that would block part of view maybe but still see through at worse case in large gaps in bars.  When I got there the bars were higher than the website showed and the area was the press box now so had chairs, table, and a black screen all over the bars.   I literally could not see anything past the three point line.  If i just sat on edge of chair and leaned forward barely touching my chair I could see the hoop from an angle but still nothing more and not see one side of the court.  The staff said too bad it said limited view on ticket too bad if you cant see past the  3 point line, they said the website was out of date and inaccurate so nothing they will do.  I missed a good chunk of the game since cant see baskets at one end literally cant see the hoop or anything inside 3 point line.  I emailed them and no response received.  Game was good from what i saw but ticked at how I was misled and they just say too bad.  We tried to move seats to empty ones but sold out game so hard to do adn watched good part of game without seeing one hoop until lady in our row felt bad and let us sit in her seats which were better view since she goes to lots of games.  Not cheap seats since it was chicago but brutal view and staff just said too bad and no response since my email to them.   Attached picture is my actual view taken while sitting in my seat."
4,"this new venue is nice but the penny pinchers could have relaxed and spent a little extra on wider corridors. On the upper floor there was hardly enough space to navigate through the massive crowds that have the appreance of being overwhelming. Other than that, this place is very nice and a great place to see a basketball game. Brook-lyn, Brook-lyn, Brook-lyn"
5,"The Center is a great venue for a concert, the line getting in was easy and they did not do any frisking.  once inside lines for food was fine and alchohol was long,  getting beer isn't problem but you will wait 30 mins for a real drink.  iyou know this going in then drink before you come. There are great bars along 5th street across from the center.The workers at the arena were very friendly and accommodating and the ushers on the floor were helpful and kept the aisles clear.  The show was tremendous and the sound was great.  If you buy seats behind the stage then you get what you pay for.  We were row 10 on the floor and had an unbelievable view.I would definitely come the Barclays Center again."
5,"where to start? purpose built sports arena that has great seating, reasonable priced concessions, and even in the cheaper seats feel that you're close to the action.plus free wifi!"
5,"I have seen many stadiums but this is one of the coolest so far. If you are a basketball fan, get that VIP combo package.We traveled in from DC to watch the Brooklyn Nets vs Chicago Bulls. Got 2nd row front court tix incl VIP access. We got the VIP bands which let us in the catered food area under the stadium. I am a picky eater, but their buffet options were great. From fresh carved steak to chicken wings, sushi, sausages and much much more, cake, icecream, salads and even ice cream and a candy bar for the kids. Really really cool location. Totally worth the money and a lifetime memory.Note: if you do that, be there early so you can enjoy it all. We got there 1 hr before the game started. Almost shoudl have been there earlier."
5,It is cool from the outside and is well made. I was ment to be going t o a nets game but did not feel that well once i was there so just left.
5,"Had a great time watching the Brooklyn Nets..Its a new arena so its pretty modern..Great entertainment during the game,,just a fun place..Now a few problems..I thought they needed a few more inches for leg room,,,if you want something from the concession stands you better load up because the lines are very long...Very easy to get to the Barclay on the Subway from Penn Station and Grand Central..The subway stop is directly in front of the Barclay,,just make sure you follow the signs.."
5,"I went with my family to watch Brooklyn vs Chicago last week and we have been amazed by this wonderful sport venue.Since I did not want to spend a fortune, we chose sector 211, row 11 (still quite a good amount of money, but this is NBA) and I have to say that I was surprised of how well we could see the ground and the match.The match was great and the overall show was great as well (from a famous singer singing the flag hymn to intermissions shows during time-outs and breaks).I was happy to see Brooklyn and Chicago fans sitting close to each other in a very friendly atmosphere.When the match ws over, I was afraid to be congested among 17k fans or being pushed heavily by the crowd down to the subway station (my children are 10 and 12), but again, everything went perfect, with a relaxed and very safe atmosphere.A great evening of sport in Brooklyn."
4,Great facility. No large soda but you can get a small or large beer. Like all other arena's the food was expensive but that is expected. The staff were really good about watching their section and solving issues (people constantly standing or in wrong seats).
4,"We saw Green Day on April 7. First trip to the Barclays Center. Arena is clean and well-kept, of course, it is also brand-new. The staff is outstandingly friendly and welcoming. Barclays Center, continue to treat your staff well. It's very enjoyable for the customer. Concessions are pricey, of course - $4.50 for a Starbucks coffee and you can't bring drinks in from the outside, of course. However, there is a Starbucks at street level with a separate entrance. Our seats were in the first row of section 215. I was a little surprised that the plexiglass barrier in the first row seemed a little low. I felt I could pitch over the side without too much trouble. However, the show was excellent - sound, atmosphere, etc. Yes, they should have made the corridors a little wider. It was a bit of a shuffle after the show. Subway access is excellent - we came and went from Grand Central."
1,"We came to France to see Miguel &amp; Alicia Keys show. I'm 33 year old and my wife is 32. It's important for the following story. It first became with the waiting time to get a beer. A guy with long hair was pimpin some ladies at the bar instead doing his job. I waited for 25 min to ask for 2 beers (while some people in line quit). I was ask my ID and when I gave my french ID he told me he cannot accept it. He asked to his manager who called its own manager who told me ""sorry, we only take passeport"" I asked the guy to check my french ID and to get the driving licence of my wife but he stayed in this stupid position. To conclude the first part of this adventure, we manage to get a beer by asking someone to take it for us. Your rule regarding international ID are nonsense. It follows then with the location of our seats. How come you can enjoy a live show from behind the scene ???? 201 / 17 / 7 &amp;8 was our seats. We were amazed to see that Miguel first part was almost unseeable while half of the scene was hiden. Even the musicians were hidden. If you had a poor sound, it was by far the worst concert of my entire life. Regarding Alicia Keys, it was  almost the same : no vision if the artist, poor sound, no vision of the musicians, no giant screen...I don't even know if somebody gonna read this but i swear there's no way I can come back to Barclays center."
5,The only thing that could have made things better was a seat next to Beyonce! Stadium is sweet inside and out. High end food and imported beer. Just beautiful.
5,"I saw Swedish House Mafia's ""One Last Tour"" here and it was incredible. The amount of people that can fit in the area really makes for a great concert atmosphere. The bouncers were also really cool; they quickly took care of people that were being obnoxious but were perfectly friendly to anyone that behaved themselves. We were in section 25 which was just to the left of the stage (from our perspective) and it was a great view. Excellent concert venue and I'd definitely come here again.Just be warned if you go in the winter; there's no coat-check. Be prepared to carry your jacket or sit on it."
5,"A great venue , easy to access a 10 min walk , the area is safe to walk to from the hotel .Parking is easy even on a big event night Once inside the arena has brilliant viewing areas , you will not be dissapointed"
5,It was cold outside and they were able to keep the line moving so we waited no more then 1-2 mins outside. Staff inside was friendly and helpful. Will def attend and event at this venue.
5,We saw Swedish House Mafia at Barclays! Amazing show and great place to watch. Venue has dynamite angles to see the show. Very large yet makes you feel close the action. Insane sound system and great acoustics.
5,We bought tickets on line through a reseller and had never been here before. The facility is beautiful and very easy to get to on numerous subway lines. The shops near by are nice and food inside though pricey was good. We had good seats and our team won. Life is Great. Go VCU RAMS
5,"Very easy to get to and from, event was awesome, great arena. Comfortable seating and nice ice-cold beers!"
5,"We had decided to buy the all session pass since we are big college basketball fans. No particular affiliation with any of the teams. It turned out to be an amazing experience. The Barclays Center exceeded my expectations. Perfect venue and very easy to get to from many subway lines. For a sports arena the food was excellent. Prices were high, but typical of arenas, and not unexpected. Our seats were amazing. The top off to the whole experience, though, was the outstanding service. Every staff member greeted us and welcomed us to the Barclays Center. Everyone smiled. It was truly a happy experience."
4,"The Barclay Center in downtown Brooklyn is a sleek, new modern state-of-the-art arena taking all the business away from the other local arenas in the New York City tri-state area. In The short to use the arena has been up and running it has definitely proved to be a sensation in the neighborhood bringing in the top middle and lower new up-and-coming X and performances at a reasonable price .It is centrally located in downtown Brooklyn annexed to the Atlantic Terminal Mall. Serviced by more than 11 different trains and buses and the Long Island Railroad it is definitely a well thought out location and venue.The inside itself, is Sleek modern and up today. It is not built like the older arenas flat and spread out, it is built like the new electronic-based arenas everything is erected straight up in the air very steep. The steepness and tightness of the seats can be a challenge for morbility challenged persons and people afraid of heights. The seating is small European styled but comfortable seats but poorly numbered given the steepness of the arena and the very tight placement of the seating. The view is great from the 5 different levels of seating I have experienced from the nose bleed upper levels to the floor and VIP level. The suites are beautiful and classy designed by Calvin Klein.The amenities are equally as expensive as they are plentiful. Bottled water the least expensive item on any of the menus and selections starts at $4.50 per bottle. Unless you are a high roller better eat and drink before coming or risk going home empty handed and pocketed, especially if you a family or party of more than one.The staff depending on your luck can be very good and courteous or they just plain suck, not enough supervisors visible and available to resolve disputes. The layout and flow of traffic is amazing with numerous exits well spaced at the street level. The ticket office when open is professional and efficient, but again when you can catch it opened.Overall, the Barclay Center is an asset and welcome addition to the community offering and providing needed jobs and stimulus to the local economy. Most community members find them to be very eager to hire the youngest workforce possible and are very hostile towards the older adult and senior workforce."
4,"It's a great venue.  Even sitting in the upper deck, we had a great view and felt like we were part of the game.  We could even see Jay-Z!  Tickets were reasonably priced and with an overtime game won by the Nets at the buzzer, the entertainment value was high.  Easy access from the subway."
5,"Caught a Nets vs Milwaukee game at the new Barclay's centre and it was amazing. Great view of court from everywhere....centre is well built and super clean. Strainght subway (2,3) from times square-took about 20 min. Nets won in OT which resulted in ecstatic crowd!"
4,"Recently went to a game here and had a great time! The other reviews are on point, the staff is EXTREMELY friendly and helpful which really made it an enjoyable first experience. Sat in Section 109 and had a great view and access to the club level. Also a very convenient location right off the subway, would definitely go again!"
3,"Every staff member which we encountered was extremely friendly and professional. Impressive, especially since this type of establishment usually is not service driven. Not a good venue for musical performances. Went to see Marc Anthony and the sound was poor. Exiting the building was very slow. The hallways are very narrow. It would be hard to exit safely and quickly in the event of an emergency."
5,"In mid-January a close friend suggested that I go to a Brooklyn Nets basketball game with him. Not only was I not a basketball fan (notice I said WAS), I have a strong dislike for attending any live sports performances other than hockey games. Barclays changed all that for me. Not only am I now a basketball fan (Brooklyn, of course), but I've been back 3 times since and have tickets for another 3 games before the regular season ends in April! What did Barclay's have to do with my change of heart? Everything. First of all, you cannot get a bad seat at this arena. While there are a very select few areas with obstructed viewing, they are few and far between. From the moment you enter Barclays, you get the feeling that the staff are genuinely happy to see you there. From the irresistable food offerings to the pristeen bathrooms, extremely well-dressed and polite young men and women really go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your experience at the center. Speaking of the food... to die for. I've had the pleasure of both purchasing both Regular Admission and All-Access tickets and would recommend the All-Access tickets hands down. All you can food, including access to the North and South Club Buffets are the way to go. Expensive, not really. Pick up your tickets on fan-resell sites (think Stub Hub, etc.) and you can find tix for less than half of face value. Believe me, it's worth every penny. All you can eat from killer spots like Buffalo Boss, Brooklyn Burger, Paisano's, Williamsburg Grill, Calexico, Fatty-Cue... and the luist goes on and on. Did I forget to mention all you eat Junior's cheesecake and Blue Marble ice cream?! Don't know how the arena sounds for music performances, but based on what I've seen so far, these guys are doing a bang-up job."
5,"Brooklyn's Barclays Center is the new home to the basketball NBA team, the Brooklyn Nets, and a fabulous venue for music, exhibitions.  Go there and you will be in for a Brooklyn treat. Before the Brooklyn Dodger took off for LA in the 1957, a new domed stadium was going to be built on a site near where the Barclays Center is located.  The Barclays Center has all kinds of retail stores nearby, but the real draw is real Brooklyn neighborhoods like Park Slope, Boerum Hill, Prospect Heights.  There are great local restaurants, and Prospect Park is also nearby.  So go there and get a wonderful and fun taste of Brooklyn."
4,So many sorts venues are bland and boring..well from the moment you see the Gehry design outside you know this is going to be special.  Lots of great spots to eat inside- i recommend the Cuban sandwich - a live dj booth  -cool interior -its a great place to go
5,Every single employee I came in contact with when at the Barclays for a concert  was so nice! I even overheard other people on the floor talking about how friendly everyone was...so unusual for a big venue like this
5,"Easy access, lots of security, reasonable cost on seats. The nets won in 2x overtime. Fans were great! ( we were rooting for the home team)"
5,I was there with my son....we had a great time watching the net game and eating. Getting to Barclay center was so convenient.
5,"Went to see the Brooklyn Nets versus the Orlando Magic,,Exciting,Clean and New New New!!!!!Entertaining and Fun!!"
5,"I loved having the opportunity of going to a new stadium to see the Brooklyn Nets. The atmosphere on the way there felt great. We had seats in the last row but it was still worth it for only $15! Get there if you can, a cheap night out in NYC!"
4,"We were staying at Lincoln Centre... but it was so easy to get to Barclays. Just 15- 20 mins on the 1 train to Atlantic Ave... perfect! A bit of a rush to get back to the subway at the end... but nothing we couldn't handle. The stadium is very expensive for food and drink, but there are cheaper and nicer places in the area so arrive early. Even the cheap seats are good here... for NBA anyway. We came two or three times and had a really positive experience each time."
4,"On a business trip to NYC, and met up with some friends to take in the Brooklyn Nets vs Orlando Magic at the spanking new Barclay's Centre last night . What a fantastic venue and what a fantastic atmosphere. Having lived in NYC a few years back The Garden used to be the must attend, but this was a great sprung experience and I recommend it to one and all. We had Club Deck seats which offered an excellent view and a private bar area. Will definitely be on my agenda for my next NYC jaunt, but hopefully against better opposition than the Orlando, not so, Magic."
5,"We came to the Barclays Center December 2012 to watch a Brooklyn Nets basketball game and we really enjoyed it.The Barclays Center is very close to a number of subway lines and the building itself is very impressive.  When we arrived the line to get inside wasn't very long and it moved along very quickly.  When inside everything is marked very clearly and you can find where you are meant to be without any problems.  There is a vast amount of different food stalls and places to get drinks too.The atmosphere was great and the seats were very comfortable, we would love to visit again!"
4,We went to the nets vs heat game. The arena itself was done nice there are a lot of options for food and drink. It is well organized in terms of letting people in and out. The ticket prices like the Knicks is too high in comparison to all the NBA teams. We sat at a angle which I was worried about but the seats were actually good.
2,"Went for a Mumford and Sons concert but missed 3/4 of it because people were smoking pot everywhere.  Being that I'm pregnant I have NO desire to be around that. (Wouldn't even if I weren't)  Other people other than myself told security about it and although they attempted to put a stop to it by telling people not to do it, it didn't do any good.  As soon as they turned their backs the people had it lit up again.  I spent almost the entire concert out of the arena because of it.  May as well been listening to the radio.  Flew to New York just for this concert and I'll never come back.  They need to be throwing these people out or conducting searches instead of a verbal request not to do it."
4,We went to see Mumford and Sons concert at the Barclay centre. Nice place with decent chairs. Beer is on the expensive side but a good size. The place is huge.
5,"Went to the Lakers vs. Nets game here.  I mean, wow, what a nice place!  It is so impressive.  The exit off the subway as I took the elevator up to ground level was unforgettable, as the center came into view.  The lighting was perfect yet mysteriously dark, since the main color seems to be black.  I felt Jay-Z's influence all over the place since he helped design/decorate the place, I believe and since he is part owner of the Nets, etc...  The game was awesome (Lakers won!) and it seems to be a great place for a concert.  Good times."
1,"As a woman living with late stage breast cancer, I have feverishly been trying to cross things off my ""bucket list"".  One of the items on the list has been to take my 16-year-old son to a concert.  On Wednesday, February 6th, my husband and I took our son and his buddy to see Mumford &amp; Sons at the Barclays Center.  Living out on Long Island, we are not familiar with the area where the center is located.  We researched on line and phoned the center, and were advised the Long Island Railroad was our best choice.  Barclays Center urges people NOT to drive there, but to use mass transit.  The tickets indicated the performance started at 8:00 pm.  The last train out was 11:14 pm.  We warned the boys they might miss the encore, but they WOULD get a chance to experience their first concert.  Imagine our shock and dismay when we realized that Mumford &amp; Sons wasn't coming on until 10:00 pm!  We were able to hear HALF the concert before running for the train with a bunch of other very disappointed fans.  A friend of mine indicates the same thing happened to him last month, and when he called the Barclays Center to complain and tell them they should not be advising people to take the train, they told him he should learn to read a train schedule.  In addition to the disappointment, I had held off chemotherapy so I could be well to enjoy the experience with my son--our window of opportunity has just closed.  We paid a GREAT DEAL of money to be in Section  8 with a good view of the stage.  Apparently, the row we were on was being used as the direct route to the floor, and the workers had lines of people blocking our view for a good part of the performance while they checked tickets with a glaring flash light.  We could have definitely gotten high on the amount of pot smoke all around us.  I've got a seriously compromised immune system and don't need to be exposed to pot smoke!  Overall, I am very disappointed with the Barclays Center and would not recommend anyone going there.  Mumford &amp; Sons is amazing, but not worth the total of $800 (!) we spent to see them for an hour.  Shame on you Barclays Center!"
5,"Watched a Nets game here. What a space. We sat right up high, which freaked me out, but the view of the game, and the feeling we were in it, was ideal. Good people spaces, well lit, lots of food stuffs, and drinks. Friendly staff always help. Transport in and out couldn't be easier."
5,I am impressed with the layout and ease of getting to this arena.  It is modern and has something to offer everyone.  A variety of food is offered.  The shops are stocked with the latest gear.  The fans and energy in this arena are contagious.
5,"The venue is amazing, and the food vendors were awesome, Nathan's Hot Dogs, L&amp;B Spumoni Gardens. Great place for basketball, concerts etc..."
5,"Amazing venue and not too many areas considered ""bad seats"". The area has lots to offer for ""pre-gaming"" before your event."
4,Acoustics wonderful.  Screen placement average.  Seats cramped.  But the concert was 8/10.  I'd do other concerts.
4,"We went to Barclays for a Coldplay &amp; JAY-Z Concert on NYE. The arena was really stoic in person; took the escalator up from the subway and it was this giant presence...everyone was taking pictures. Inside, we enjoyed the modern facility; everything was brand-spanking new, as to be expected. Charging stations for cell phones are brilliant. Staff were nothing but friendly and all smiles. Drinks were STEEP! A double vodka soda and a Skinny Girl Margarita was $50. No joke. Perhaps it was just because it was NYE, but damn, that's a lot of money for three drinks.The sound was pretty good for Coldplay but Jay-Z had the bass up way too high; hard to hear for a while. Concert was three hours long with a DJ intermission in between; my ears are STILL ringing. No joke. Bring earplugs and protect your ears. Permanent tinnitus is not the way to start the new year!Would definitely return again for another show or sports event."
2,"We travelled from the UK to see Leonard Cohen at The Barclays Centre. It was a cold night and we had to wait outside for the doors to open. Once inside the huge venue it was still cold. I had received three emails reminding me of the occasion and warning me not to be late so we were surprised when so many people were still taking their seats half an hour after the show should have begun which meant that Leonard Cohen couldn't start. I have seen him perform four times in the recent past and he has always started promptly. And what a restless audience - people were constantly getting up, even in mid song, to get more supplies of food without any thought for spoiling others enjoyment of the show. Why ever are people who arrive so late allowed to buy food before coming in. I felt so angry at the lack of respect showed to the musicians and interested members of the audience by these perpetual gobblers. I have never witnessed anything like it - or the smell from the different fast food outlets which was nauseating. I certainly wouldn't visit again until (or if) the management sort this out. Leonard Cohen however was his usual magnificent self - it was a shame he was let down by some members of the audience and the venue."
5,"What better place to see my favorite band in my hometown...Barclays Center!! We were here Dec. 30th and it was a wonderful experience.  The Barclays is the perfect venue for a concert.  It feels intimate even though it was a 20,000 attended event.  The food was exceptional.  We had the best time and can't wait to see Coldplay again and see a NETS game (who thought anyone would say that)!!"
5,"We saw the Bob Dylan concert here in November 2012. The Barclays Center is incredible in its size and amenities. Having a basketball team downtown Bklyn is a huge plus for the area. The restaurants in the center were varied and eliminated the need to go to a restaurant before the show. The place is clean, and the staff very friendly and helpful. If you're seeing a concert there, avoid paying more money for floor seats because there is no grading to the floor and you'll fall victim to people who stand and wave their hands during the concert and effectively obscure the view of a dozen rows behind them..."
5,I don't care what sow is going on in there when your there if you have an opportunity to go into The Barclays Center do it!!! Ut's Amazing.
4,They're doing something right here because ALL the employees extend a warm welcome to the guests who enter. I have to say that we were attending a Disney on Ice performance with thousands of young children. I don't know what the atmosphere is like if it's a hockey or B-ball game. Venue feels intimate. Prepaid parking worked fine but it is more than a half mile away (the lot we were in). The area has lots to offer in terms of places to grab a bite.
5,"Considering its capacity this place is incredibly slick and a model for other stadiums. No queues to speak of...incredible to be able to buy food, beer, use the facilities etc without a major queue. We watched the Brooklyn Nets and loved the spectacle of it. Amazing evening."
4,"We had the pleasure of seeing Barbra Streisand's Back to Brooklyn concert.  I was very impressed by the venue in which she performed, the Barclays Center.  It was new and clean.  What most impressed me was the friendliness of the staff throughout the facility.  Each staff member that we encountered had a kind word.  My one suggestion I have for the Barclays is that they need a taxi stand outside their facility."
4,The arena is beautiful and is doing wonders to revitalize the neighborhood.  It's easily accessible from the subway and comes with all the bells and whistles of the modern facility.  The one big drawback is how steep the seats are.  The rows are set on an extreme angle making climbing them a bit treacherous.  Hope that no one slips and falls!
4,"Whoever thought of coating the outside in rust should be shot.  However, the sight lines for basketball are excellent and as someone else has noted, the arena employees go out of their way to be friendly and this makes for a very pleasant atmosphere.  Public transportation is a snap and there doesn't seem to be the neighborhood overload that people were afraid of.  Food is decent for arena food, a step up from the Garden and there is sufficient staffing so the lines are reasonable, something other sports venues should emulate.  There's a chicken and rice dish that's quite tasty - can't recall the vendor, but easy to find."
3,"There are lots of things that could be said about the Barclay's Center.  1. Easy to get to as it right at the top of the subway steps.2. They open the doors an hour before the event starts.  It was cold the night we were there and I was happy it was dry.  Why make people stand out in the weather if they get there early??3. It's slow getting inside because they scan everyone...!  Oh come on?! At a Bocelli concert?4. Typical American junk food at extremely high prices is sold in :(5. Get $14 plus tip out if you want a drink of no-name brands.6. We paid $200 each for our seats and they were fold-up seats jammed in next to each other. No arm rests like the real seats had.  They didn't mention that on the website.7. People bring the stinky junk food into the auditorium (like they are at a game) and eat it while the concert is going on.8. Never saw a coat check so we all had to sit on our coats.9. The cement floor was freezing cold.  No problem is you have sport shoes on, but cold if wearing leather or thin soled shoes.Somehow BOCELLI overcame all of this and the concert was excellent, but it would have been better to see him in a concert hall instead of a sport stadium."
4,"Not sure where the arena came from, but I don't believe they could have been nicer or more accommodating. Visited the Center for the first time at the Rolling Stones concert and was blown away by the courteous staff members.  The arena was very nice and felt comfortable.  I liked the extra stalls for the ladies and did not have to wait in a line to use the facilties.  The only ""issue"" was actually getting into the arena.  We had to wait in long lines once we went through security to provide our tickets to the checkers.  The area around the Center was jammed with vehicles and not being from NY, I wonder if mass transit can be used as the streets were even more clogged than an 8:00am trip across town."
5,We enjoyed the venue and of course the incomparable Stones!  The Barclays Center building is like a huge spaceship that landed in an urban space.  Makes you wonder what it crushed when it came down.  But a great place to hear music.
3,"Although the look is great, and the workers are nice, the food I had was below average and cost way too much. Its more like going to a rap concert than anything. Had great seats and saw a great game but probably wont go back. I was disgusted by the amount of noise and things yelled during the national anthem."
5,"The Barclays Center is a great place to see basketball with the family.  There are a ton of different food and drink services.  You will please everyone's pallet.  The care that went into designing the arena is evident.  It really fits into the look of Brooklyn. There are restaurants and shopping around the arena, but if you are planning to step inside, wait to eat there.  You can buy a $6 bucket of popcorn from the main service and get free refills.  If you buy from the kiosk with the cool looking popcorn buckets, it's just $5 with no refills.  There are several different bars for drinks, Starbucks kiosk, Stoli Vodka kiosk, etc.  The Metro PC photo booth is a fun place to get a picture and send it to an email address, no charge.  So glad we had the opportunity to visit and will return."
4,This is a nice Baskeball facility. Had a hard time getting a phone number to make dinner reservations inside Center.
4,I was at Barbara Streisand opening night.. Concert was well run. Staff was well trained and polite.Of course she was fantastic.
5,"At first, I was not sure if the subway was best the way to go to get to the Barclay Center in Brooklyn from Manhattan, so I hired a car. As the Barclay Center came into view from the rear seat of my car, I was immediaitely impressed by its sofiticated look, with its curved lines and edgy feel.  The royal blue lighting that cascaded down from the roof to the entrance graced the building with an almost astral feel, as if it were floating in air above the booming and jammed packed streets of Brooklyn.What a night I was anticipating!  Barbra was back to her roots and was expected to give the performance of her life.  This arena, seemed almost too appropriate for this milestone concert.  The whole experience from the moment I stepped foot out of the car to the very end of the concert was not only what I hoped it would be,but more than I could ever have dreamt of.  The entrances were spacous and entering the complex was very easy, even with the tight security patrol checking everyone as they entered.  Once inside, the immaculately clean concourse of the Barclay Center was jammed with food and beverage stands.  There was no wait time to get a drink. Even though the drinks were pricey, $10.50 for a pint of draft beer, it was well worth it.Entrance to the seating area was a breeze, and for 20, 000 seat arena that is no easy feat.  What I was absolutely thrilled about was that the seats were big enough for a grown person to sit comfortably, with plenty of leg room and arm room to relax and enjoy the show.  The view was stupendous and the sound quality was AAA.  Navigating the bathroom was a breeze and there was no wait time to use the facilities!  Yahooo!The show itself, and Barbra, were both magnificant.  Words cannot describe the thrill of seeing her perform live again.  It was as if time stood still, and for a brief few hours there was no strife or grief in the world, just harmonious happiness brought about by the pure joy of seeing and listening to the most incredible talent of our time!The subway back to Manhattan was a breeze to find and to get on.  Steps from the main entrance of the Barclay Center are the entrances to the subway and all the numerous trains that stop at the Barclay Station!Whatever the occassion, get yourself to the Barclay Center!  You will not be disappointed and time for you, as it did for me, while I was there, will stop for a brief few moments and you will find as I did, that I was truly at peace with myself and the world!  What an experience!  Now go, and have some fun!My thoughts and prayers are with all of you brave and wonderful New Yorkers in your time of recovery.  As a survivor of Katrina and the 6 most horrible days of my life, I know what you are going through right now!  A big shout out to all my family and friens in CT and NJ too!"
4,You can get to the Barclay Center by public transportation very easily.  I went to a Net Game.  I did not appreciate the fact that there was a tattoo parlor on the first floor that night.  The food is way overpriced and not that good.
4,While visiting NYC a friend took us to the game. Was very easy to get to as a bunch of subways stop right in front of the arena.  The staff from the lady handing out promotional items to the concession employees were all warm and actually welcomed you to the arena (what NBA game does that ever happen). The food vendors were all local eateries.  Hats off to the staff and everyone involved.  Job well done.  Earlier in the week we went to the garden for a game and there is no comparison the level of service.
5,"Barclay's Center is Fantastic!! Went to the Legends Classic NCAA Basketball Tournament.  Great new venue.  Great job Brooklyn, you have hit a home run. Whis I could say the same thing about the Hotel BPM..."
5,"Great, ultra-modern arena in a revitalized Brooklyn.  College hoops, Brooklyn Nets, and soon the NHL."
4,"Food in the VIP lounges are real good and gourmet.  If you are a season ticket holder for the Nets and have a certain classification, you eat for free in the designated lounge area.  There's about 5 or 6 restaurant options that have a decent menu to offer attendees."
5,"Easy access and a beautiful indoors stadium. Very organized and great view point from pretty much wherever you seat. Went there to see THE WHO and the sound was spectacular. You can enjoy whatever you are going to watch there having a soda, beer, popcorn or a sandwich."
4,"at 45 bucks per head.... the atmosphere was excellent the caesar salad was great , the prime ribs were very good albeit rare was not available....the mini knishes were excellent....I did not try the striped sea bass but my son liked it...the hamburger sliders were good....the chicken did not appeal to my tastes but it is difficult to find chicken in a place that serves it on the bone and to my taste...the mac and cheese was not bad"
5,"I attended the opening night for the Brooklyn Nets.  It was my first visit to the 1 Billion Dollar facility.  All I can say is Money well spent!  First class all the way.  It is convenient to all mass transportation....both subways lines and trains, so getting there should never be an issue.  As far as parking, I suggest you book a space online if you do drive.  I went this route, you can either do this through the Barclay Centers website or through parking wiz.....you not only guarantee yourself a space....but you get one at a discounted price to boot!  The food venues are very good....several of the choices are from local Brooklyn businesses....like Juniors or Scotto's....come hungry, it is worth it.  The sight lines to the game are very good and the seats are comfortable and roomy.  A first class facility for a first class Borough."
5,"We saw the basketball opener, Brooklyn Nets vs Toronto Raptors, and thought the sight lines were excellent. We bought our seats from a re-seller (stubhub) and because of the hurricane that hit the east the prices were more reasonable- also it was not a full attendance. The design of the place is really great and glad Brooklyn has a team to root for!"
4,"We to a concert at the new Center and the commute was so easy on the LIRRit is accross the street from the center. Very organized , lots of staff working and ladies this is a biggie, tons of bathrooms and no lines!!! Food and drinks were the normal concert hall crazy prices, not any more than any other place."
5,Booked pre season tickets through vivid for $35 each. Great place brand new great staff good food and drinks easy to get to on the subway straight out of the station. Well worth a visit. Great atmosphere.
